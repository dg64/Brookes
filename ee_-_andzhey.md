# EE - Andzhey

## Predicted Grade C

Criterion A 5

The research question is clearly stated and a number of sources are used to support
the analysis. The topic selected is far beyond the syllabus, but even though there
some points points of contact like the trend lines used in the technical analysis

Criterion B 5
There is evidence of good understanding of the topics presented, even though the
essay does not goes beyond the presentation and explanation of those topics

Criterion C 3
The research and the analysis are limited; a lot of words are spent explaining the
different tyupe of tradying, but no quantitative analysis and/or comparisons of the
effectiveness of the technical analysis over other tools is made. The conclusion, also,
does not answer the research question. We know that the technical analysis is used, but
not to what extend is reliable and when traders prefer other tools instead of it

Criterion D 4
The presentation and the formatting of the document are good; references are present all over the text,
and suppord by footnotes.
