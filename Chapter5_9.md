## BUSINESS IN CONTEXT

### Big data and decision-making in supermarkets.

Supermarkets produce a huge volume of data. There are millions of transactions per week, so data managers can measure the impact of even small changes, such as a small price increase to one product.

Every product purchased, along with its price, is recorded in huge databases, with tables exceeding hundreds of billions of rows. Loyalty card schemes allow the supermarket businesses to create a complete picture of a customer's entire history of transactions. The richness of this data provides support for management decision-making on pricing levels, promotions, personalized communications to consumers, new products and ranging.

Ranging is about which products to sell in each store. Every square metre of each aisle is potentially worth thousands of dollars of sales per year. Supermarkets goto great lengths to make sure none of it is wasted on products that do not perform well. But 'performing well' is not as easy as picking the highest selling products or those with the biggest profit margins. Stores have to cater to all of the different customers who come into them. For example, a particular type of sauce might not be a big-selling item, but if it is important to the older demographic, then to stop stocking it might force them to shop elsewhere. Also, imagine someone is planning to make burritos this evening. If they can get most of the ingredients in one store, but it does not sell tortillas, shoppers may end up taking all of that potential revenue to a competitor.

At the same time, a diverse product range costs money. There are complex logistics of managing a large range of different products. More products mean more supply chains to manage. Consumers in a budget supermarket like Aldi, will notice it often has a smaller choice of products for each product type, but it maintains higher stock levels in store. This is to cut down on the costs of a diverse product range, enabling lower prices at the expense of choice, before reducing quality.

This all makes for a very complex optimization problem in which data analysis plays a key role. Products are regularly assessed against a number of criteria such as sales, profitability, number of customers who purchase them and the loyalty of those customers to a product when it is not on promotion. Machine learning models (using the principles of artificial intelligence), trained on past examples of range changes can be used to predict how customers will react to proposed changes in the future. By taking store characteristics into account, such as size, local demographics and proximity to competitors, ranges can be optimized on a store-by-store basis.

While supermarkets are already big users of data analytics and AI, there are many interesting concepts that may become more mainstream in the future. Customer tracking is imperfect in its current form. Using loyalty cards to identify customers will bias the 'identified customers' towards those with a more frugal mindset. Another problem is that if someone enters the store but leaves without buying, their visit is unrecorded. Facial recognition technology and blue-tooth beacons could be used to plug these gaps and even provide data on how people paused at and how long they spent in store will bring further refinements in the layout of the store and the effectiveness of in-store promotions.

Obviously, there are major ethical implications with these new technologies which may slow their roll-out in liberal societies.

#### Discuss in pairs or in a group:

- How could a supermarket use the data it collects to help with pricing decisions? Try to use the concept of price elasticity in your discussion  
- To what extent do you think the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data has 'major ethical implications'?

## KEY CONCEPT LINK

### Change

The retail sector of the economy is subject to constant change both instore and online. Businesses that can use big data effectively can use it to support their marketing strategies in response to this change. If information tells a clothing retailer such as Ralph Lauren about changes in consumers' preferences in terms of colour, material and design, then the retailer can alter the products it sells in response to this, In this sense, big data helps business manage change.

## Data Analytics

Operating a business of any size can lead to the generation of vast amounts of data from all functional areas such as operations performance, cost and profit center performance, HR data and marketing data such as consumer buying habits. The purpose of **data analytics** is to analyze data to identify trends, correlations and insights that can be used to help make informed business decisions.

Data analytics is significant as it plays an important role in helping businesses to optimize their performance. A company can also use data analytics to make better business decisions and help analyze consumer trends and levels of customer satisfaction, which can lead to new (and improved) products and services.

Data analytics is usually based on the data collected by an effective **management information system (MIS)**. This is a set of systems (nearly always IT based) and reporting processes that gather data from a range of sources. The data is then sorted and compiled in meaningful ways and presented in an accessible and usable format. The data collected and presented from a MIS can then be subject to detailed data analytics.

## Databases

Our personal details are almost certainly recorded on countless business and government IT-accessed **databases**. The storing and use of this data is regulated by law in most countries.

IT databases are vast stores of organized information from which data can be sorted, collated and delivered to a business user with a click of a mouse. Business databases help small-business owners and managers of larger businesses to organize and track their customers, stock and employees. The data they contain allows, for example, up-to-date customer relationship management techniques to be used, stock tracking of each item used or sold by the business, HR records on every employee and operations database for accurate scheduling of production to meet demand.

## Cybersecurity and cybercrime

The internet has provided businesses, governments and people with opportunities to communicate, download images and films, buy and sell products globally, and even just keep in touch. The internet has also provided huge opportunities for criminals too, and it has assisted in the birth and development of crimes using computers for aimed at computers. These actions are referred to as **cybercrime**. In 2020, businesses, governments and individuals spent an estimated $145 billion on systems designed to reduce the risk of cybercrime attacks \- these systems are known as **cybersecurity**.

The five main forms of cybercrime are:

- **Phishing scams**: emails sent from an internet criminal disguised as a communication from a legitimate, trustworthy source with the aim of tricking victims into handing over sensitive information or installing malware  
- **Website spoofing**: creating an exact copy of a trusted website with the aim of leading visitors to a phishing site. What appear to be 'legitimate' logos, fonts, colours and functionality are used to make the spoofed site look realistic.  
- **Ransomware**: a form of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid to the criminals  
- **Malware**: software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.  
- **IOT hacking**: gaining illegal access to internet-connected devices such as VOIP phones, Wi-Fi office printers, Siri and Alexa units.

Most cyber crimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cyber criminals. However, some cyber crimes are carried out against computers or devices directly in order to damage or disable them. Other criminals use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cyber crimes do both by targeting computer systems to infect them with a virus, which is then spread to other machines and entire networks.

The primary impact on businesses of cybercrime is financial. The costs include:

- lost sales if a website is infected or suspended due to illegal action  
- the cost of cybersecurity measures  
- payment of ransoms  
- reputational damage, reducing trust in the business if, for example, customers' data is hacked and published

Cybercrime impacts on the global economy. According to Atlas VPN, when the cumulative cost of cyber incidents was added to the economic outlay of putting security measures in place, the cost of cybercrime was more than $1 trillion in 2020\. This estimate suggests that around 1% of global GDP is lost in cybercrime.

### Activity 3.6.1

#### The increasing cost of cybercrime

If it continues to grow at 15% a year it is estimated that cybercrime could cost the world economy $10.5 trillion annually by 2025\. This is a huge cost to businesses, individuals and governments. In fact, the costs of cybercrime are greater than those of natural disasters and the illegal drugs market.

The top five cyber crimes are: phishing, cyber extortion, data breach, identity theft, harassment.

The costs of cybercrime come in the form of data destruction, lost productivity, stolen intellectual property, data theft, fraud and reputational harm. If you add the cost of developing systems to protect businesses against cybercrime it is clear how expensive it is.

Research a cybercrime incident involving a business and prepare a presentation that sets out all of the possible costs to the business.

## Critical infrastructures

Critical infrastructures are the systems, networks and assets that are so essentials that the security of the organization \- perhaps even the nation \- is at risk if there is a large scale failure of them. For a business, its IT system is undoubtedly part of its 'critical infrastructure'.

### Artificial neural networks

**Artificial neural networks** (ANNs) are created to make a series of programmed computers operate like a human brain.

ANNs can be created to recognize handwriting or people (facial recognition) in just the same way that humans can. We use the interaction between our eyes and millions of brain cells to achieve recognition. ANNs can be programmed to be around 99% accurate when identifying handwriting and recognizing people's identity from an image.

One business use of ANNs is to improve marketing strategies. The systems can process masses of information very quickly. This includes consumers' personal details, shopping patterns, and their responses to special offers in promotions. Using this information, businesses can identify and target the customers most likely to purchase a specific product by communicating information about them..Focusing marketing campaigns in this way saves time and money that would otherwise be wasted advertising to customers who are unlikely to respond.

### THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE

#### Emotion

Facial recognition technology offers businesses the opportunity to measure the reaction of consumers to marketing content. By identifying individuals based on their facial characteristics, facial recognition systems can be used to analyze facial expressions. This information is used to measure an individual's emotional response to areas of marketing such as product design, packaging and promotion. Software in the system can be used to detect human reactions such as fear, joy, anger and surprise.

In pairs or as group discuss the extent it is possible to measure human emotion using facial recognition technology.

### Data centres

Traditionally, businesses with substantial IT assets used a dedicated **data center** to house them.

Data centers provide the following important services to a business:

- **computing**: the memory and processing power to run the applications, usually provided by high-specification servers  
- **storage**: important business data is kept in a data center, on media such as solid-state drives, with multiple backups  
- **networking**: interconnections between data center components and the outside world, including routers, switches and application-delivery controllers.

In addition to IT equipment, a data center will need substantial investment in hardware and processes to ensure that it can provide continuous operation to the business. This equipment will include: power subsystems, uninterruptible power supplies, ventilation and cooling systems, backup generators, and cabling to connect to external network operators. The importance of data centers to the efficient and continuous operation of a business cannot be overstated, and software and hardware security measures are essential.

### Cloud computing

The high cost of building, maintaining and updating data centers has led to many businesses using **cloud computing** either to support their data centers or to replace them. Since 006, cloud computing service providers, such as Google, have been offering businesses data storage and management services on remote servers with access to data via the internet.

Basically, a cloud data service is a remote version of a data center, that is located somewhere away from the physical premises of the business. It lets a business access data via the internet. The cloud service provider undertakes maintenance and updates. These providers often own multiple data centers in several geographic locations to safeguard data during power outages and other failures.

A business that is considering using cloud computing services rather that its own data center is likely to consider three major factors:

- **cost**: The construction and equipping of a new data center can cost millions of dollars. A cloud service provider will charge annual fees or subscriptions for the services it provides but it is likely to be more cost-effective, especially for smaller businesses. As the data needs of a business are likely to change over time, the cloud provider should be able to scale the level of service offered up or down quickly.  
- **capacity**: A data center might still be preferable for a business that needs a dedicated system giving full control over data and the hardware. A dedicated data center could be more suited for a business that needs to run many types of applications and complex workloads.  
- **security**: Using a cloud service provider means entrusting it with all of the business' data. The level of security will be decided by the cloud provider. The data held in the cloud can be accessed by anyone with the proper credentials from anywhere that has an internet connection. This is convenient, but it creates many access points, all of which need a high level of security to ensure that data transmitted to them is secure.

## Virtual reality (VR)

This application of technology in the form of creating **virtual reality** is having a significant impact on several functional business areas.

Business applications of virtual reality include:

- **Retailing**. Virtual reality heat mapping can track the products and displays that most attract consumers' attention as they walk round a store. VR can allow shoppers to explore products in a lifelike way, such as Ikea's virtual reality kitchen experience which helps shoppers discover kitchen features and imagine how they would feel in their own home. VR stores are never crowded, they have highly attentive assistants, and can contribute to a personalized shopping experience. During the pandemic many estate agents used VR to promote the interiors of properties for sale which could not be viewed in person.  
    
- **Training**. VR training packages can be individually designed to meet the training needs of each employee. They can save on the cost of off-the-job training. Some retailers use VR packages to help prepare staff for very busy periods such as Black Friday. Immersing employees in a lifelike environment of long queues and possibly threatening crowds of people prepares them for an environment which is not an everyday occurrence. It also means that day-to-day business operations do not have to be disrupted for training purposes.  
    
- **Manufacture and product design**. VR can help manufacturers cut costs of designing new products and building detailed prototypes by creating a VR simulation of the product. With the development of a new aeroplane, for example, the precise location of safety features such as oxygen masks and life jackets can be tested and optimized through VR.

## The internet of things (IOT)

Although the term was first used in 1999, according to Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group (IBSG), the **internet of things** came into existence between 208 and 2009 as that was the point in time where more 'things or objects' were connected to the internet than people in the world.

One of the first examples of an internet of things is from the early 1980s, and it was a Coca-Cola machine, located at Carnegie Melon University. Programmers in the university could connect to the refrigerated appliance via the internet, and check to see if there was a drink available, and if it was cold, before making the trip to buy it. It is estimated that by 2025 there could be 42 billion devices connected to the internet. With no internationally agreed central security standards or compliance procedures underpinning this proliferation of IOT devices, individuals and businesses are likely to be exposed to IOT hacking for the foreseeable future.

In the consumer market, IOT technology is closely associated with products that claim to make homes 'smart'. These include devices and appliances such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances that can be controlled by smartphones and smart speakers. The IOT can also be used in health care, and one example illustrates the potential security risks of this. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in 2017 about implantable cardiac devices which are at risk of attack by hackers. These implants are used to monitor and control heart function, including heart attacks, and because they are accessible to hackers, unscrupulous people could control shocks, alter pacing and deplete the battery.

## Artificial intelligence (AI)

Research into machines which can simulate human thought processes has been undertaken since the days of the very earliest electrical computers. With the huge increases in computing power that have been achieved in recent years, **artificial intelligence (AI)** has now become a reality.

There are some common examples of AI in action:

- Siri, Alexa and other smart assistants  
- Self-driving cars  
- Robot financial advisers  
- Conversational bots in customer service environments  
- Email spam filters  
- Manufacturing robots that use AI  
- AI recruitment and selection of candidates applying for a job  
- AI assessment by a bank of loan risks to business customers

### Impact of AI on business

In a business, AI can:

- save time and money by automating routine processes and tasks such as recording of financial transactions and analyzing market research data  
- increase productivity and operational efficiencies, for example by using AI-controlled manufacturing processes  
- avoid data analysis mistakes and 'human error', provided that AI systems are set up properly  
- use insight gained from analyzing masses of customer spending data to predict customer preferences and offer them a better, personalized experience  
- mine vast amount of data on potential customers to generate new contacts with them and increase the customer base  
- increase revenue by identifying and maximizing sales opportunities  
- offer intelligent advice and support, for example with customer service focused chat bots.

### AI and the future

There is little doubt that AI is far better at data analysis than a human brain is. Artificial intelligence software can analyze massive sets of data and make suggestions to the human users about how to respond to the results of data analysis. Managers can use AI to help assess the possible consequences of each possible course of action. This improves the accuracy of decision-making, but could the business be managed completely using AI?

With the many automated tasks that AI can currently perform, some people are certain that AI-controlled technology will lead to all business jobs \- including senior management decision-making \- being undertaken by machines. Several business analysts disagree, however. They recognise that many jobs will be replaced by machines, even some accounting, legal and HR positions, but that the human element in decision-making will be required for years to come. Also, the growing trend towards AI-based systems will require many people to be employed in programming and providing business support to AI-focused businesses.

A well known firm of business analysts, McKinsey, has suggested that 50% of today's work activities could be automated by 2055\. Integrating more AI and process automation into the workplace will change the nature of many people's jobs. Those that are displaced by AI may be able to find other employment, and many workers will have to change careers, so flexibility and access to appropriate training will be essential.

### Activity 3.6.2

#### Data mining

The personal information of 533 million users of a social media site was found posted online by a hacker. It included names, birthdays, phone numbers, locations and email addresses. According to the company, the stolen data had originally been taken a few years before due to a vulnerability that the company put right in 2019\.

Cybercriminals could use the revealed data to impersonate people and access their banking details and other important personal information.

In pairs or as a group, research other major security breaches that have occurred because of business data mining. Prepare a presentation on your findings.

## Big Data

**Big data** refers to vast quantities of complex data that is difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods. The amount of data that businesses now have access to is increasing each year. Only the latest data analytics systems can cope with interpreting and analyzing it.

Where does all of this data come from that is flowing into businesses? There are many sources including:

- details of transactions between the business, its suppliers and customers  
- IOT devices  
- social media  
- feedback from cost and profit centers  
- feedback from AI-controlled machines  
- feedback from customers.

Not only is the volume of data increasing, but the speed at which it arrives is getting faster. This requires a very fast system for analyzing and responding to the data. Another factor that has made big data so essential to business managers is that the variety of formats in which information is received has also grown. Some examples include: numerical data, structured database data, unstructured text documents and messages, social media  messages, email and stock movement data.

There are just some of the potential uses and benefits of big data for businesses:

- **Recruiting the right employees**. Recruiting agencies can scan candidates' CVs (resumes) and Linkedin profiles for keywords that would match the job description. The recruitment process is no longer based on what the candidate looks like on paper and how they are perceived at interview  
    
- **Increasing sales**. The digital footprints that customers create when browsing online or posting to social media channels can tell a business a great deal about shopping preferences, beliefs, response to promotions and so on. This data allows businesses to adapt products to exactly what the customer wants.  
    
- **Increasing productivity and efficiency**. Quicker data analysis will increase the personal productivity of the specialists employed within a business. The business can also gain a lot of information about its own operations, productivity of each work team, feedback on customer experiences and variances from budget for each profit center. This data allows management to gain insights into its own operations and to recognize areas where it could be more productive and effective.  
    
- **Reducing costs**. The use of big data to help make forecasts about future material and commodity cost movements could encourage a business to source cheaper materials. More efficient preventative maintenance programmes could be assessed using output and breakdown records from thousands of pieces of equipment. Rapid analysis of operations data about quality control levels should lead to rapid action to cut wastage rates.

Big data is not without its potential problems, however:

- Questionable data quality \- perhaps from potentially unreliable consumer surveys or social media platforms \- will make the resulting analysis of the data potentially risky for the business. Decisions taken on the basis of the analysis of unreliable data could prove damaging for the business.  
- The huge amount of data has to be kept very securely, especially if it includes sensitive data about customers' personal details. The data is at risk from attack as cybercriminals could use this data illegally to their own advantage.  
- Data centers are costly to purchase, manage and maintain. Cloud-based analytics and specialist providers of data management solutions could partly overcome these problems, but their services will involve subscriptions costs.  
- High salaries are demanded by experts in the field of big data analysis and by professionals who know how to design and manage the necessary infrastructure. Collecting and analyzing big data is not a low-cost course of action, but if it is undertaken effectively, the benefits could outweigh the costs.

### Case study 36.1

highly strung tennis (HTT) is a medium-sized business based in Madrid that manufactures high-quality tennis racquets. Whilst the game's major stars are tied to the world's leading sports goods manufacturers, HTT has developed a niche market selling to leading amateur players in Europe and to tennis clubs and academies.

HTT has used AI extensively in its manufacturing processes, particularly in product design and quality control. HTT's use of data in the production of its racquets has enabled it to reduce product faults by 15%. Machine-based digital diagnostics has enabled HTT to pinpoint machinery errors and improve maintenance on the production line.

AI has helped HTT target consumers more effectively, by using intelligent systems, the business has been able to understand its customers better and track their buying patterns. This has been particularly important in guiding product design and advertising.

## Customer loyalty programmes

Developing **customer loyalty** to ensure that they buy from the business in the future is closely related to **customer relationship marketing (CRM)**. Studies have shown that it can cost between four and ten times as much to gain new customers (with expensive promotions) as it does to keep existing ones. Increasing the loyalty of existing customers makes sense for another reason. If a business can secure repeat purchases from many **customers with customer loyalty programmes**, it means that there will be fewer customers buying products from competitors.

Customer loyalty programmes are designed to encourage repeat purchases by providing the customers (often called ‘programme members’) with discounts, unique offers, VIP events, points-based reward systems and free trials or tasting of new products. When it is well managed and appropriately focused, a customer loyalty programme should:

- retain existing customers  
    
- encourage them to increase their spending

- encourage ‘dormant’ customers to return

- attract new customers.

At the heart of customer loyalty programmes is communication with the customer to gain information. Hence the need for ‘big data’ analysis. The aim is to gain as much information as possible about each existing customer. This includes income, product preferences, buying habits and so on. Using this information, marketing tactics can be adapted to meet the customers’ needs. This is virtually segmenting each customer, and it is the opposite of mass marketing. Now that technology has made the collection and analysis of customer data so much easier and cheaper, customer loyalty programmes are becoming a widely adopted marketing strategy.

Developing effective long-term relationships that lead to customer loyalty can be achieved by:

- **targeted marketing** – giving each customer the products and services they have indicated, from records of past purchases, that they most need  
    
- **customer service and support** – after-sales service and effective call centres are good examples of the support that is essential to build customer loyalty  
    
- **regular communication with customers** – to give frequent updates on new products, special offers, new features, new promotions and support services  
    
- **using social media** – obtaining data and feedback from customers via social media sites, which allows tracking of, and communication with, customers.

| Costs | Benefits |
| :--- | :--- |  
| IT systems and data analytics software needed, and training of employees to respond to customer feedback. | For businesses with an existing customer base it has proven to be cost effective. Higher sales from effective loyalty programmes nearly always exceed the cost of analysing customer data and offering suitable rewards. |
| Effective customer loyalty campaigns may require the use of an external marketing consultancy at high cost. | It is a sustainable strategy for creating long-term customers, unlike ‘low price offers’ or similar promotions which tend to be short term in impact |
| Customer loyalty programmes require an existing customer base. This needs to be established first before investing in loyalty programmes. If this is not done the costs will not lead to higher sales. | Loyal customers often recommend the business to friends and family, providing additional marketing benefits at no cost. |
| May be costly to respond to each customers’ feedback which might contain special requests or requirements. | Lower cost per customer than trying to attract new customers. |

**Table 36.1**: The potential costs and benefits of customer loyalty schemes

### Case study 3.6.2

#### Four great customer loyalty programmes

Here are four famous brands that offer their customers loyalty schemes:

- Starbucks will give you a free drink on your birthday and offers you free in-store refills on coffee and tea. The Starbucks Rewards programme also provides convenience. Customers in the reward scheme can skip the line and order their personalised beverage before getting to the store.  
    
- Reebok provides members of its loyalty programme VIP experiences such as training and wellness programmes, and members receive reward points for every transaction.  
    
- Disney has teamed up with different retailers to offer its members reward points for purchasing movie tickets. Members also can also redeem rewards for exclusive experiences such as the Walt Disney Studios private tours.  
    
- Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream offers customers a free scoop of ice cream for signing up to its loyalty scheme. The business offers its members the opportunity to order and pay with their phones, view the latest flavours, and buy customisable ice-cream cakes.

Feedback management software platforms such as Confirmit and Satmetrix combine a company’s internal survey data with trends identified through social media. This allows businesses to make more accurate decisions about which products to supply to satisfy customers’ needs.

The costs and benefits of customer loyalty programmes need to be considered before a business adopts this strategy. See Table 36.1.

## The use of data to manage and monitor employees

The data increasingly available to managers does not just cover production rates, machine reliability, customer loyalty rates and so on. It also monitors the performance of each individual employee. The use of data gathered and analysed electronically is referred to as **electronic performance monitoring (EPM)**.

What data can HR managers gather and analyse about employee performance? Here are common examples:

- rate of working or productivity  
    
- degree of work accuracy  
    
- customer satisfaction/complaints feedback  
    
- log-in and log-off times  
    
- days absent/late  
    
- number and duration of breaks  
    
- social media activity.

These data sets can be compared with those of other employees and, if benchmarked data is available, with employees in other businesses. If there are a series of results which show declining performance then managers can focus on improving standards from the employees concerned. It could lead to focused training, target setting and detailed appraisal schemes, all with the objective of improving performance to, at least, above the current average on all measures.

### The big question to ask about EPM is: Who benefits?

Opponents of EPM argue that, as with F. W. Taylor’s original ideas, the aim of EPM is to improve every aspect of employee performance for the benefit of the business with higher output, lower costs and increased profit. In fact, this approach to using employee data to improve performance is often referred to as ‘**digital Taylorism**’. It is argued that workers are treated like machines, and that the only factors that managers consider important about employees’ work and achievements are those that can be measured. This approach could be very demotivating.

### Activity 36.3

When you call a business you may hear the statement: ‘Your call may be recorded for training and quality purposes.’ In an effort to improve employee performance, organisations like call centers are increasingly using technology to electronically monitor the work of their employees. The use of electronic performance monitoring (EPM) allows managers to continuously monitor the work of their staff in real-time.

In pairs or as a group discuss the impact that EPM might have on your work as a student.

Taylor originally argued that the best way to boost productivity was to enforce three rules in the workplace:

- break complex jobs down into simple ones  
    
- measure everything that workers do  
    
- link pay to performance, giving bonuses to high achievers and replacing underachievers.

Modern digital Taylorism builds on these three rules with the application of big data about employee performance.

In an article about Amazon in the New York Times it was suggested that Taylorism is thriving. The article claimed that the internet retailer uses classic Taylorist techniques to achieve efficiency: workers are constantly measured, the data is analysed digitally and those who fail to reach performance targets are ruthlessly eliminated. Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, insisted that he did not recognise the company portrayed in the article.

Supporters of this use of HR employee performance data suggest that the measures taken to improve employee performance could result in benefits to both the business and the employee. They claim that:

- improving employee performance can improve business competitiveness and increase job security as a result  
    
- pay levels could increase if targets are continually met  
    
- bonuses could be paid for certain levels of improved performance  
    
- training to improve performance can be rewarding and motivating  
    
- effective appraisal schemes can encourage employees to suggest ways in which they could improve their own performance, giving them a sense of responsibility to improve performance.

The evaluation of the impact of digital Taylorism must depend on how the HR data is used, the relationship between managers and employees and whether the business aims to help workers achieve self-fulfilment at work. Failing to communicate the reasons for data collection and the mutual benefits that could result from improved employee performance will almost certainly result in fear, demotivation and uncooperative attitudes from employees – to the detriment of workers and the business.

### LEARNER PROFILE

In pairs or as a group, discuss the extent to which the use electronic performance monitoring (EPM) in the work environment is a principled way of managing staff.

## The use of data mining to inform decision-making

**Data mining** is used to establish information from huge amounts of data that could be useful for decision-making.

There are several types of data mining, including pictorial data mining, text mining, social media mining, web mining, and audio and video mining. Data mining can help to solve business problems and answer business questions that traditionally were too time consuming to resolve manually. Using a range of statistical techniques to analyse data in different ways, managers can identify patterns, trends and relationships that would otherwise not be obvious. They can apply these trends and relationships to predict what is likely to happen in the future, and they can take decisions to influence business outcomes.

Data mining is used in many areas of business and research, including sales and marketing, product development, health care and education.

Potential uses include:

- Promotion – establishing the relationships between marketing and promotion campaigns and consumer responses to them. This helps marketing managers use appropriate marketing campaigns to target consumers.  
    
- Marketing strategies – using data mining techniques, businesses can create data models to test new ideas. Managers can more easily identify the customers who will be interested in their products. New products that the businesses launch on the market will have a greater chance of being successful.  
    
- Banking and finance – patterns of credit card activity can be monitored, which helps to highlight illegal fraudulent activity.  
    
- Manufacturing – using operations data manufacturers can detect faulty equipment and determine optimal quality-control parameters. This helps to reduce wastage and achieve high levels of acceptable quality.  
    
- Decision-making – by analysing data from previous business decisions such as locating new retail franchises, managers can determine the most important factors that lead to profitable levels of sales. The relationships between these factors and sales performance will help in future decisions about where to locate new branches.

Potential limitations include:

- Privacy issues – concerns about personal privacy are increasing and this might limit in future the amount of personal data that consumers are willing to provide to businesses.  
    
- Security issues – security is a big potential problem. The data that a business gathers and stores about its employees and customers (including social security numbers, dates of birth, payroll and other information) needs to be held securely to avoid damaging confidence and trust in the organisation.

### Past relationships and trends may not apply in future

Basing business decisions on the analysis of past data is always risky, no matter how effective the mining and analytical techniques. Consumer spending patterns may be affected by external events such as an economic recession which did not feature in the data already gathered. Competitors’ actions such as the launch of an advanced product will influence the relationship between promotion and sales for another business. Operations data in the past might not have been affected by supply chain issues, such as those that existed during the pandemic, but these will impact on major operations decisions taken now.

### Case study 36.3

Supermarkets use data mining and business intelligence extensively. Supermarket loyalty card programmes are driven by the desire to gather comprehensive data about customers for use in data mining.

The US retailer, Target, used a data mining program to predict if its shoppers were likely to be pregnant. By looking at the contents of its customers’ shopping baskets, it could spot customers that it thought were likely to be expecting a baby and begin targeting promotions for nappies, wipes and other baby-related products. The prediction was so accurate that Target made the news by sending promotional coupons to people who did not yet realise (or who had not yet announced) they were pregnant\!

## The benefits, risks and ethical implications of advanced IT

We have already analysed the benefits of using advanced computer technologies in creating management information systems. Using big data and data mining, for example, informs and improves business decision-making. However, there are serious moral or ethical issues that must be recognised and discussed as IT advancements make the gathering, storing and analysis of masses of data easier and less costly.

Here are some of these ethical issues:

- Information rights and obligations. What access rights do individuals and organisations have with respect to information that has been collected about them? What can they protect? What can they demand to see? What can they demand to be destroyed?  
    
- Property rights and obligations. How will traditional intellectual property rights be protected in a digital society? It has become more difficult to trace and identify the ownership of such rights.  
    
- Accountability and control. Who can and will be held accountable and legally liable for any harm done to individuals and organisations by the misuse of data held about them?  
    
- Levels of security. What standards of data storage and system security should society demand to protect individual rights and the safety of society?  
    
- Protecting values. What values should be preserved in an information- and knowledge-based society? Which cultural values and practices are supported by the newest information technology?

### Some examples of ethical questions raised by technological advances

A new data analysis technology called non-obvious relationship awareness (NORA) has given governments and the private sector powerful profiling capabilities. NORA can take information about people from many unrelated sources, such as employment applications, mobile phone records, customer loyalty data and police records, and establish relationships to find obscure hidden connections that might help to identify criminals. For example, NORA can instantly discover, before he boards the plane, that the man at the airline ticket counter shares a phone number with a known terrorist. The technology helps in making society safer, but it does have ethical implications because it can provide detailed profiles of the activities and associations of individuals.

Advances in networking are greatly reducing the costs of moving and accessing huge quantities of data. They mean that large data pools can be mined remotely, permitting an invasion of privacy on a large scale. The development of global digital superhighway communication networks raise many ethical and social concerns. Who will be held accountable for the flow of information over these networks? Will it be possible to trace information collected about each individual? What will these networks do to the traditional, formerly private, relationships between family, work and leisure?

Governments are responding to the potential risks and threats posed by big data. Most national or state governments have passed laws that give individuals rights to know what data is held about them and how to access it to check it. For example, in the US, the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the supplementary 2020 California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) are data protection laws that are being copied in many other US states. The European Union is considering banning the use of artificial intelligence for a number of purposes, including mass surveillance and social credit scores which can be used to reward or punish citizens for their behaviour.

What are the key principles that these laws should aim to protect?

- **Private customer data and identity should remain private**: private data obtained from a person with their consent should not be able to be used by other businesses or individuals if it allows tracing back to the individual’s identity.  
    
- **Shared private information should be treated as confidential**: other user businesses (‘third parties’) often share sensitive data – medical, financial or locational – and restrictions should be in place regarding whether and how that information can be shared further.  
    
- **Consumers should have transparency** around how data on them is being used or sold, and the right to manage the flow of private information between powerful, third-party analytical systems.  
    
- **Big data should not make choices for us**: big data analysis can influence and even determine who we are before we make our own choices. Businesses should think about which predictions and inferences they make about us should be allowed and which should not.  
    
- **Big data should not reinforce unfair biases** like racism or sexism. Machine learning algorithms can absorb unconscious biases in a population and reinforce them in the courses of action proposed by the data analysis.
