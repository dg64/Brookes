# Test 1.2 Ustinya

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	2/4
		The answer is correct but theoretical; you must apply the content to the context.
		What does it mean for Larry and Sergey start a partnership?

Question 3	0/4
		No answer. Why?

Question 4	3/10
		Here also the answer is theoretical and the structure is not correct; for 10 points
		you must write a mini essay with 2 advantages, due disadvantages and a conclusion.
		Changing Google from a partnership to a PLC allowed Larry and Sergey to get rid of
		legal identity and unlimited liability; with a PLC, they have a different status and
		they also have access to sources of finances that are accessible only to PLC's.
		On the other hand this change implied the loose of control of the company and the
		risk of a potential take over.
		In the end we can say that the flotation of Google brought to Larry and Sergey more
		benefits than drawbacks.
