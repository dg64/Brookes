# Project Management

Starting up three projects at once, with one of them being the introduction of an information system, is a challenge per se.
The challenge increases if the time frame given is only three months. In this report I will try to explain how these three projects can be carried out, and what is, in my opinion, the best methodology for project management to apply to this specific case.

Among the three projects: Introducing a new information system, Improving the corporate site, Implementing loyalty policy program, the first one is the most complex and it needs to be started first; the other twos can start while the first one is running. In particular, the project bout the Improvement of the corporate site has some connection / constraints with the main project, so in order to be implemented and fully tested, some functionalities of the Information System need to be release (customer data, subcontrators data). The implementation of the loyalty policy program is also quite simple and short and it only requires some decisional meetings in which the policies will be defined; these policies involve discounts, benefits and exclusive offers to loyal customers; again the implementation on these policies, require the customer data are uploaded and tested in the information system.
