# Project Management

Starting up three projects at once, with one of them being the introduction of an information system, is a challenge per se.
The challenge increases if the time frame given is only three months. In this report I will try to explain how these three projects can be carried out, and what is, in my opinion, the best methodology for project management to apply to this specific case.

Among the three projects: Introducing a new information system, Improving the corporate site, Implementing loyalty policy program, the first one is the most complex and it needs to be started first; the other twos can start while the first one is running. In particular, the project bout the Improvement of the corporate site has some connection / constraints with the main project, so in order to be implemented and fully tested, some functionalities of the Information System need to be release (customer data, subcontrators data). The implementation of the loyalty policy program is also quite simple and short and it only requires some decisional meetings in which the policies will be defined; these policies involve discounts, benefits and exclusive offers to loyal customers; again the implementation on these policies, require the customer data are uploaded and tested in the information system.


The methodology chosen to manage these projects is Prince2; below the reasons of this choice over PMBOK
- PMBOK is activity oriented, while Prince2 is product oriented; given the really short time, I think is better to focus on the deliverables and then to the activities that are needed to produce the deliverables; this focus makes also simpler to define the acceptance criteria and the quality requirements that the deliverables / products must have
- Both PMBOK and Prince2 have a phase of "initiation project", but in PMBOK this phase is longer and it is started without the Project Manager, while on Prince2 the Project Manager is assigned immediately. Considering the time frame of the project, it is vital that the Project Manager sets the standard and the governance of the project immediately.

- Some processes that are present in PMBOK aren't really required on this project; the short time poses great constraints on the choice of the ERP and the cloud provider, meaning that the supplier managament proceess and the risk management process related to them will be dealt with immediately and it will last no more than one-two weeks.

- One of the 7 principle of Prince2 is "Tailoring to suit the project"; this principle allows to adapt the methodology to the size of the project; being the main project very constraint in time and being the other two projects very small in comparison to the main one, it is important not to overwhelm the projects with unnecessary beureacraucy that will have as only result a dely in the delivery date.

- Last but not least, while PMBOK poses the responsibility of the project on the Project Manager, Prince2 poses the responsibility of the project on the Project Board (customer, sponsor, stakeholders); this is because the project is not created for the Project Manager, but for the customer / sponsor; the member of the project boards are responsible for giving authority and resources to the project manager. PMBOK works well when in a company there is a Project Management Office, but in companies where a project manager need to work in a matrix environment (especially a weak matrix), Prince2 becomes more effective.

To conclude, there is one aspect missing in the planning, and this is done on purpose: the online ordering of products from the corporate site. Beside the fact that implementing also this functionality in three months is not realistic; there are also technical features / constraints related to the choice of the ERP platform; once the information system is consolidated, then it will be possible to implement an e-commerce site connected to it.
