Paper 2
========================

## Overview of Paper 2

- Paper 2 is predominantly a quantitative paper.

- It is complemented by the new business management toolkit (BMT) - see below for further details.

- Unlike Paper 1, there is a separate paper for SL and HL students in Paper 2.

- HL students have an additional question in Section A (due to the additional content coverage of HL only topics).

- In Section B, an extended response question (essay) is included, for both SL and HL candidates.

- SL Paper 2 = 1 hour and 30 minutes, worth 35% of overall weighting.

- HL Paper 2 = 1 hour and 45 minutes, worth 30% of overall weighting.

- Total marks for SL = 40 marks, and for HL = 50 marks.

- All 5 units of the syllabus can be assessed.

- A calculator is required for Paper 2. All calculations can be completed using a 4-function calculator.

- The official formulae sheet must be provided (by the school) in the final examination.

- All answers are to be written in the answer booklet, provided as part of the examination paper itself (unlike in Paper 1, and unlike in Paper 3 for HL only candidates).

### Paper 2 and the Business Management Toolkit

Students are expected to use the **BMT** in answering specific examination questions,  such as shown in the specimen HL Paper 2 Question 4d (**STEEPLE analysis**) and Question 5d (**Boston Consulting Group matrix**).  An example of such a question is:

"*Using the data provided in Table X, the information in the stimulus, and a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, recommend to Company Y which product should be removed from its portfolio in order to remain profitable.*"

Contents of the BMT can also be explicitly examined in the Paper 2 exam.  For instance, have a look at the specimen HL Paper 2 Question 3(b) (i) and (ii),  which refer to the **mean average**,  as well as Question 3(b) (iii) which refers to the **line of best fit**.

Please note that the BMT is applied to the contents of the syllabus whilst the context is given in the question paper in the examination.  Four examples are provided below for illustrative purposes:

1. With reference to **force field analysis**,  explain the reasons for resistance to change amongst the employees in Company X (Unit 2.1 - reasons for resistance to change in the workplace AO2).  *[6 marks]*

2. Using a **SWOT analysis**,  discuss whether Company A should merge with Company B (Unit 1.5 - Mergers and acquisitions AO3).  *[10 marks]*

3. Using the data in Table,  other information in the stimulus,  and **Porter's generic strategies**,  recommend which marketing strategy Company Y should use to gain a competitor advantage over its competitors (Unit 4.2 - How organizations can differentiate themselves and their products from competitors AO3).  *[10 marks]*

4. Using your **decision tree** calculations and the information in the stimulus,  discuss whether Company B should choose Option 1 or Option 2.  *[10 marks]*u79

Students will not be asked to analyse or evaluate any of the tools in the BMT in isolation.  For example a question such as “*Evaluate SWOT analysis as a business management tool*” will not be asked in the examination.  The skill is to be able to use/apply relevant tools in order to address the demands of the examination questions.

### Tackling the extended response (10 mark) question in Paper 2

- Using the data provided in Table X and Table Y, and other information in the stimulus, recommend which ... [10]
- Using the data provided in Table X, information in the stimulus, and a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, recommend to YY whether it should pursue Option 1 or Option 2. [10]
- Using the information in the stimulus, discuss the impact of ... on the decision to ... [10]
- Using the information in the stimulus, evaluate XX's decision to ... [10]

- Recommend to Co. X's board of directors whether they should ... [10]

To score 9 – 10 marks (the top mark band), students must demonstrate evidence of the following:

- Clear focus on addressing the demands of the question.
- Relevant and accurate use of business management tools and theories.
- Relevant information from the stimulus material is integrated effectively to support the argument.
- Arguments are substantiated and balanced,  with an explanation of the limitations of the case study or stimulus material.
