TOK Exhibition
========================

The TOK Exhibition is an individual task, taking up around 8 hours of teaching time, and is completed at the end of the first year of the DP.

It involves students choosing 3 ‘objects’ and one of the 35 IA prompts, and writing a commentary to demonstrate how TOK concepts manifest in the real world.


## The TOK exhibition assessment strands

The overall assessment objective of the exhibition is to show how theory of knowledge manifests itself in the real world. In order to do this, the assessment ‘instrument’ looks for four different skills that you are expected to demonstrate in your exhibition.
 
Make sure you understand what each strand is, and that you are able to explain how you’ve included each one. To find out more about each aspect of the exhibition (IA prompts, objects and commentary), follow the links that take you to the other pages of the TOK exhibition.

1. **Interlinking ideas**
Your exhibition commentary should clearly explain the links between the objects you have chosen, and the IA prompt, and explicit references are made to the selected IA prompt.

2. **Justifying ideas**
Your exhibition commentary should include a strong justification for why your have objects have been chosen for the practice exhibition. This should be done within the context of the core theme, or one of the optional themes.

3. **Using evidence**
All the points you make in your commentary should be well-supported by evidence. In other words, all of your ideas and opinions should be supported by real-life situations, or the ideas of key thinkers.

4. **Identifying the real-world context**
The exhibition clearly identifies three objects and their specific real-world context. These means choosing actual objects (or images of objects), rather than generic objects.


## The TOK exhibition prompts

Once you’ve understood the basics, and have grasped what the assessment rubric is looking for, you can think about which IA prompt to choose. This comes from the list of 35 prompts in the TOK subject guide.
 
Your IA prompt links your three objects to the TOK course, and enables you to demonstrate how TOK manifests itself in the real world. The context you’ll use for this will be either the core theme or one of the optional themes.

### Selecting an exhibition prompt

#### The ‘BQ filter’

35 prompts mean that there is a lot of choice with your exhibition, and it’s easy to get lost amongst all the possibilities. By applying a filter to the prompts you’ll understand them better, and be able to make more sense about what they are asking. Our way of structuring the course should help you. We divide the course up into 6 ‘Big questions’ (BQs), each one of which exploring a different aspect or concept related to TOK. You can see the BQs on here.

#### Step 1

Think about the aspect or concept behind each BQ, and then match this up to what’s being asked by the IA prompts. For example BQ2 looks at the relationship between knowledge and how we construct our values. This links to several IA prompts that focus on ethics, such as 16 and 27. BQ4 explores bias and perspectives. A lot of the IA prompts relate to this; for example, 12 and 28.

#### Step 2

After you have matched up the BQs to the IA prompts, you begin choosing one that will work for you. Be motivated by what interests you, what matches up to concepts you’ve found interesting during the TOK course, and what resonates with your own experiences, both inside and outside school.

#### Step 3

Your exhibition should be set within the context of the core theme, or the optional themes. So your third step is to head over to those sections of the site, and have a look at the Big Question that relates to your IA prompt. Check out the quotes, the notes, and the real-life situations that we’ve put together. This will give you more of an idea about what your exhibition will focus on, and the objects that you’ll select.

#### Putting this in context…

Let’s say that you’ve decided to construct an exhibition that deals with the way we communicate ideas. This aligns with Big Question 3. You like the look of IA prompt number 24, which looks at the effect of the context which knowledge is presented. You’d like to base your exhibition on technology.

You’d head over to this page of the site, and find quotes and real-life situations that relate to this BQ/IA prompt, within the context of technology. Note that if your school has membership to the site, you’ll be able to access the ‘exploration points’, which identify key terms and words, and suggestions on how to unpack the media sources.

#### The TOK exhibition objects

You need to choose three ‘objects’ for your exhibition, that should relate closely to the IA prompt that you have chosen, and enable you to create a 950-word commentary set within the context of an optional or core theme.
 
Your objects should be connected to you personally, and be things that you have encountered at school, or your life beyond the classroom. This link will keep the exhibition original, and prove your engagement with TOK.

## Choosing your objects

Before you choose your objects, you should have selected an IA prompt, and have a good idea about the context you’ll be exploring this in. You can be a little flexible about this – plans often change when you work on internal assessment – but obviously you don’t want to waste the work you’ve put into an exhibition by changing it after too long.
 
Have a good look at the examples provided in the TOK subject guide, and look at the exemplar exhibitions in ‘MyIB’ – your TOK teacher will be able to provide you with accees to these, and discuss what makes a good object. If your school is a member of theoryofknowledge.net, you’ll also be able to see our example objects to help you get a clear picture of what works and what does not.
 
Remember, you write a 950-word commentary, in which you will identifies your objects, consider its specific real-world context, and justify why you have included it in the exhibition. This should all link (ie answer) the IA prompt. We’ll talk a little more about the commentary here, but just keep that in mind as you choose your objects.

### Things to bear in mind as you choose your exhibition objects:

- Objects can be digital, not physical – such as a photograph of an object, or a Tweet posted by a person
- Objects should have a specific real-world context, and not be generic examples of something
- Objects can be something you have created, but not for the exhibition
- All three objects should link to your IA prompt
- You may not use the same objects as other members of your class (and it would be wise to extend this to ‘other members of your year group’)
- You should clearly reference the provenance of your objects when you create your exhibition file
- Your teacher can give you guidance on choosing your objects: you can discuss your ideas with them, and they can provide you with written feedback on your draft commentary

## The TOK exhibition commentary

So, you understand the exhibition rubric, you’ve selected your IA prompt, and you’ve chosen your objects. What happens next?
 
Now you have to write your TOK exhibition commentary. This is a 950-word exploration of the IA prompt, explaining why you have chosen your three objects, and demonstrating how TOK manifests itself in the real world, within the context of the core theme, or one of the optional themes.

### Writing the TOK exhibition commentary

Before you begin writing your commentary, make sure that you have seen the exemplar exhibitions, that are found on ‘MyIB’ – your teacher will give you access to these. This is a fantastic way of seeing exactly what you are trying to do with you exhibition.
 
You’re trying to do several things simultaneously when you write the commentary. First, you’re answering the IA prompt that you’ve chosen from the list of 35 options. These all ask a question about the nature of knowledge, and how we use it: make sure your exhibition commentary addresses this question.
 
Second, you are outlining the real-world context of your objects, and justifying why you have chosen them for your exhibition. How do your objects link to the IA prompt? How do they relate to your personal experiences? What makes them special, or original, or particularly resonant?
 
Third, you are showing your knowledge of the core theme, or one of the optional themes, by referring to ideas relevant to this aspect of TOK, key thinkers that you’ve come across during the course, and real-life situations that have engaged you.
 
Overall, you are trying to demonstrate how TOK manifests itself in the real world. This means showing how the ideas and concepts that we encounter during the course are relevant to the way in which we lead our lives, and the society in which we exist.
 
Keep in mind the four different strands of the assessment rubric: you should be prepared to discuss with your teacher how you are hitting these targets. Also consider the three characteristics of a top level exhibition: precise, lucid, and convincing. How is your exhibition all of these three things?

## IA prompts

The IA prompts are a set of 35 high-level knowledge questions. Students must select one of the following IA prompts on which to base their exhibition, and all three objects must be linked to the same prompt. These IA prompts apply for all examination sessions for the life of this guide—they do not change from session to session.
Students are required to create an exhibition of three objects that connect to one of the following IA prompts.

1. What counts as knowledge?
2. Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?
3. What features of knowledge have an impact on its reliability?
4. On what grounds might we doubt a claim?
5. What counts as good evidence for a claim?
6. How does the way that we organize or classify knowledge affect what we know?
7. What are the implications of having, or not having, knowledge?
8. To what extent is certainty attainable?
9. Are some types of knowledge less open to interpretation than others?
10. What challenges are raised by the dissemination and/or communication of knowledge?
11. Can new knowledge change established values or beliefs?
12. Is bias inevitable in the production of knowledge?
13. How can we know that current knowledge is an improvement upon past knowledge?
14. Does some knowledge belong only to particular communities of knowers?
15. What constraints are there on the pursuit of knowledge?
16. Should some knowledge not be sought on ethical grounds?
17. Why do we seek knowledge?
18. Are some things unknowable?
19. What counts as a good justification for a claim?
20. What is the relationship between personal experience and knowledge?
21. What is the relationship between knowledge and culture?
22. What role do experts play in influencing our consumption or acquisition of knowledge?
23. How important are material tools in the production or acquisition of knowledge?
24. How might the context in which knowledge is presented influence whether it is accepted or rejected?
25. How can we distinguish between knowledge, belief and opinion?
26. Does our knowledge depend on our interactions with other knowers?
27. Does all knowledge impose ethical obligations on those who know it?
28. To what extent is objectivity possible in the production or acquisition of knowledge?
29. Who owns knowledge?
30. What role does imagination play in producing knowledge about the world?
31. How can we judge when evidence is adequate?
32. What makes a good explanation?
33. How is current knowledge shaped by its historical development?
34. In what ways do our values affect our acquisition of knowledge?
35. In what ways do values affect the production of knowledge?

The chosen IA prompt must be used exactly as given; it must not be altered in any way.
- If the IA prompt has been modified but it is still clear which IA prompt the student is referring to, the TOK exhibition should be marked as using the original IA prompt. Any lack of relevance in the student’s response arising from this modification will be reflected in the score awarded.
- If it is clear that the TOK Exhibition is not based on one of the IA prompts listed, the TOK exhibition should be awarded a score of zero, in accordance with the TOK Exhibition assessment instrument.

## Objects

An extremely wide variety of different types of objects are suitable for use in a TOK exhibition. Students are encouraged to choose objects that are of personal interest and that they have come across in their academic studies and/or their lives beyond the classroom.
It is **strongly recommended** that students base their exhibition on one of the themes (the core theme or one of the optional themes). This can be an extremely useful way to help students narrow down their choice of objects and give a focus to their exhibition.

<br>

### Digital or physical objects

The objects may be digital rather than physical objects. For example, students could include a photograph of an object, such as a historical treaty, where it would not be practical/possible for them to exhibit the physical object. Students may also use digital objects such as a tweet by a political leader. However, they must be specific objects that have a specific real-world context—objects that exist in a particular time and place (including virtual spaces). They may be objects that the student has created themselves, but they must be pre-existing objects rather than objects created specifically for the purposes of the exhibition.

<br>

### Context of an object

The specific real-world context of each object is extremely important to the task. It is, therefore, important that students identify specific objects to discuss rather than using generic objects and generic images from the internet. For example, a discussion and photograph of a student’s baby brother is an example of an object that has a specific real-world context, whereas a generic image of “a baby” from an internet image search is not.
Examples of the diverse kinds of objects students could select include the following.

- A tweet from the President of the United States
- An image of the painting Guernica by Pablo Picasso
- The student’s own extended essay (EE)
- A basketball used by the student during their physical education lessons
- The graphic novel The Colour of Earth by Kim Dong Hwa
- A painting that the student created in their DP visual arts course
- A refillable water bottle provided to each student in a school as part of a sustainability initiative
- A news article from the popular website Buzzfeed
- A photograph of the student playing in an orchestra

<br>

### Images of objects

The image of each object used in the exhibition must be appropriately referenced. If an object is the student’s own original work (for example, a painting that they created in a visual arts class) then this should be identified and acknowledged to ensure that teachers and moderators are clear about the origins of the object.

<br>

### Word count

The maximum overall word count for the TOK exhibition is 950 words. This word count includes the written commentaries on each of the three objects. It does not include:
- any text contained on/within the objects themselves
- acknowledgments, references (whether given in footnotes, endnotes or in-text) or bibliography.

If an exhibition exceeds the word limit, then examiners are instructed to stop reading after 950 words and to base their assessment on only the first 950 words. Extended footnotes or appendices are not appropriate to a TOK exhibition.
