The difference between JIT & JIC
========================

## Just In Time


**Just-in-time (JIT)** is a lean method of stock control which relies on deliveries of stock (inventory) being made just in time for them to be used in the production process.  JIT removes the costs of holding buffer stocks (minimum stock levels). Hence,  this eliminates the need for storage and the costs of insurance and maintenance that are associated with holding large volumes of inventory.  It is part of a continuous improvement programme, although it often becomes more difficult to manage as an organization grows in size.

Just-in-time stock control systems have stocks delivered immediately the moment that they are required for production. This helps to improve the firm’s working capital as money is not tied up in inventory, which might not be highly liquid. Conversely,  there are costs associated with any stock control system such as just-in-case (JIC).  The costs of holding stock (inventory) include but are not limited to the following:

- Storage

- Damage

- Maintenance

- Insurance

- Wastage

- Security (theft prevention

### Advantages of JIT stock control

- The system eliminates the need for buffer stocks,  so minimizes storage costs as stocks are delivered as and when required in the production process.

- Wastage is thus required as inventory does not perish, get damaged or become obsolete while waiting to be used.  Hence,  JIT is a form of lean production.

- The firm’s liquidity position improves, as cash is not tied up in inventory, improving cash flow position.

- Overall,  JIT can help to improve an organization’s competitiveness due to lower costs of stock management and improved product quality.


### Disadvantages of JIT stock control

- Due to smaller order quantities, economies of scale are less likely to be achieve.

- The system relies heavily on technology to ensure efficient stock control and movement,  but this can be very expensive and vulnerable to technical faults and breakdowns.

- The effectiveness of JIT depends on the efficiency and reliability of third-party suppliers.

- Furthermore,  suppliers can charge higher prices for urgent deliveries of stocks.

- JIT stock management is inflexible in catering for sudden increases in demand. There is the inability to meet unexpected changes in demand.

## Just In Case

Unlike JIT,  a **just-in-case (JIC)** stock control system relies on the use of reserve or buffer stocks in order to meet changing levels of demand.  By keeping large quantities of stock, the firm is able to meet unexpected orders quickly,  thus meeting the needs of their customers.  It also enables the firm to continue operating even if there are delays in the delivery of stock (inventory).  By contrast,  not having enough stock would result in lost sales and unhappy customers.

JIC is appropriate for firms that use durable,  rather than perishable,  stocks.  It is suitable across many industries.  Examples include: power tools,  batteries,  torches,  nails,  pens,  greeting cards,  Lego toys,  and toothpicks.  It is less suitable for perishable stocks,  such as eggs,  fresh fruits and vegetables,  fresh seafood,  and milk.  It is also unsuitable in industries where fashions and trends change frequently.

Essentially,  the key difference between JIT and JIC as stock control systems is that the former relies on operations that receive inventory as and when they are needed for production,  whereas the latter relies on sufficient quantities of stocks (inventories) to ready ahead of time. See table 1 below for a list of the differences between JIT and JIC.

### Advantages of JIC stock control

- A JIC stock control system uses buffer stocks so is flexible enough to accommodate any sudden and unexpected increase in the demand for a product.

- As a reserve or buffer stock exists, production can still continue even if suppliers deliver stocks late.

- As larger quantities of stock are purchased, bulk-buying economies of scale can also be achieved to a greater extent compared to a JIT system.

- It prevents a loss of customers and maintains customer satisfaction because their needs are being met (since firms don’t have to wait for stocks to arrive in order to complete production).

### Disadvantages of JIC stock control

- There are additional costs associated with JIC, which can include insurance and maintenance (including security) of stocks.

- Stocks are also subject to damage or theft.

- JIC is unsuitable for stock management of perishable products such as fresh produce (fruits and vegetables) and livestock products, such as beef, pork and poultry (game) products.

- Stockpiling (holding large volumes of stock) can harm the firm’s cash flow and working capital, especially if the stocks are not highly liquid.
