The New Extended Essay (First Teaching  2025)
========================

In early February 2025,  the IB released the new Extended Essay guide, for first teaching in 2025 and first examinations in 2027.

The Extended Essay remains a compulsory component of the Diploma Programme (DP) core. As with previous iterations of the guide,  the EE is designed to develop students' academic research and writing skills.  It allows them to conduct independent research on a topic of their choice,  guided by a supervisor who must be an appropriately qualified member of the school staff.

Note that the IB decided to target the revised Extended Essay guide directly toward students. The purpose is to highlight the independent inquiry aspect of the EE by directing essential information to students rather than (only) supervisors.

Students can choose a topic from one of their DP subjects (such as Business Management) or combine two DP subjects for an interdisciplinary essay (such as Business Management with Psychology,  Global Politics,  or Biology).  In all cases,  the research question (RQ) must be focused, and students are encouraged to select topics or areas of study where they have some prior knowledge.  The final essay should be a substantial,  well-structured,  and professionally presented piece of writing that effectively communicates the student's ideas and findings in a clear,  reasoned,  and subject-appropriate manner.

## What has not changed?

<br>

- The EE is compulsory for all students following the IB Diploma Programme pathway.

- Students can choose from one of two pathways: (i) the subject-focused pathway,  e.g.,  Business Management, or (ii),  the interdisciplinary pathway,  e.g.,  Business Management plus another DP subject such as Global Politics,  Economics,  History, Mathematics,  or Biology.

- All EEs are assessed against common criteria (including the interdisciplinary essay).

- The word count limit is 4,000 words.

- To complete the EE as an academic essay takes approximately 40 hours of work by the student.

- It involves independent research and writing on a research question chosen by the student and based on a topic or issue that is of their personal interest.

- Students must attend 3 compulsory reflection sessions with their assigned supervisor.

- The reflections (Criterion E) are recorded on a separate document and must not exceed 500 words.

- The recommended supervision time is between 3 to 5 hours (which includes the 3 mandatory reflection sessions).

- An RPF (reflections and progress form) that is left blank,  not submitted,  or written in a language other than that of the essay,  will be awarded a 0 marks for criterion E.

- All extended essays are externally assessed by an IB examiner.

- Key transferable skills of the EE include research, reflection,  self-management, and agency (see below).

<br>

| Research | Reflection | Self-management | Agency |
| ---| --- | --- | --- |
| Generating and answering questions | Reflective thinking | Time management | Creative thinking |
| Close reading | Open-mindedness | Academic integrity skills | Reasoning |
| Information literacy skills | Critical thinking | Self-regulation | Developing an argument |
| Digital literacy skills | Reflexivity | Decision-making | Communication skills |
| Analysis and synthesis | Overviewing | Ethical practice | Evaluation |

<br>

## So,  what has changed?

<br>

- The new guide includes student-centred sections.  The goal is to highlight the independent inquiry aspect of the EE by directing essential information to students rather than supervisors.

- There is no longer a timeframe constraint for Economics and History (previously 5 years and 10 years,  respectively) and Global Politics (the student’s lifetime).

- Most EEs will accept the use of primary research (although secondary research is still a formal requirement for all EEs).

- Essays only require a RQ (in the previous syllabus, students needed a topic and a research question).

- The RPPF has been renamed as the RPF.

- The reflections and progress form (RPF) consists of one single written commentary following the third (final) reflection session (the viva voce).

- After each of the 3 reflection sessions,  supervisors must record the month that the reflection session took place,  the student’s year of DP study at that time,  and then add their initials on the RPF.

- The new assessment criteria are now worth up to 30 marks (the total number of marks was 34 in the previous iteration of the syllabus).

- Subject-specific guidance is replaced with more general subject group guidance.

- The wording of markband descriptors is clearer and more concise.

- "Presentation" is no longer marked (it is not part of the assessment criteria),  but “structure” is retained (in criterion A).

- Criterion E (reflection) focuses on growth of the learner through their EE experience, emphasising skills development and skills transfer,  i.e.,  research,  self-management,  reflection,  and agency.

- Students are highly recommended to create and develop a researcher’s reflection space (RRS).

- It is recommended students have three or more check-in sessions,  beyond the 3 mandatory reflection sessions,  with their supervisor.

- New jargon has been included (see below).

## The 4,000-word count limit

<br>

Clarifications on what is and what is not considered as part of the word count limit for the Extended Essay are shown below.

The following items are included in the 4,000-word count limit:

- Introduction
- Main body of the essay
- Conclusion(s)
- Quotations
- Footnotes and/or endnotes that are not references within the essay

<br>

The following items are not included in the 4,000-word count limit:

- Cover (title) page

- Contents page

- Maps, charts, diagrams, and annotated illustrations (if used)

- Tables (of statistical data)*

- Equations, formulas, and calculations

- Citations/references (whether parenthetical, numbered, footnotes or endnotes)

- Bibliography (list of references or works cited)

- Headers

- The reflection and progress form (RPF) - this has its own separate 500-word count limit.

\* Note that students cannot try to circumvent the word count limit by putting any sort of explanation or analysis in tables or the appendices of the essay.

<br>

## The new reflection and progress form (RPF)

<br>

- The three mandatory reflection sessions must be dated and initialled by the supervisor on the RPF.*

- The reflective statement should be completed after the viva voce.

- Candidates submit only one reflective statement of no more than 500 words on the RPF.

- Hence, it is strongly recommended that students create and develop a researcher's reflection space (RRS) to support the completion of the reflective statement.

- Supervisor comment are no longer required on the RPF.

\* Note the instruction to supervisors on the RPF states: *"You must have three reflection sessions with each student,  one early in the process,  an interim meeting and then the final viva voce.  Other check-in sessions are permitted but do not need to be recorded on this sheet.  After each reflection session you must record the month that the reflection session took place,  the student’s year of DP study at that time, and initial the form.”* (RPF,  page 1)
