Paper 1
========================

## Overview of the Paper 1 examination

- There will be a pre-released statement containing two elements: (i) an introduction to the Paper 1 case study, and (ii) a small number of topics that will provide context to the Paper 1 case study.

- The pre-release statement is provided around 3 months prior to the examination, notifying candidates of the topics not in the guide that will be in the case study in the final examination. The pre-released statement for May centres is released in the first week of February (and the first week of August for November centres). The pre-released statement will be made available to schools on IBIS and the Programme Resource Centre (PRC) through the My IB portal.

- The introduction to the Paper 1 case study will be approx. 200-words and contains the first couple of paragraphs of the actual case study seen on the day of the exam. Typically, this will include some background information to the organization featured in the Paper 1 exam.

- The topics in this pre-released statement are not in the syllabus (to account for the dynamic and contemporary nature of business management). The purpose is to assess candidatesâ€™ knowledge of important and contemporary business management topics that could not have been anticipated when the guide was written.

- The rest of the case study and stimulus material are unseen and will consist of around 800 to 1,000 words released on the actual day of the actual Paper 1 examination. This will also include the introductory paragraphs as part of the pre-released statement.

- Students are asked to research these topics for approximately 5 hours, researching these topics and learning the terminology. The topics in this pre-release statement build on those contained in the syllabus.

- On the actual day of the Paper 1 exam, the IB will provide the complete case study that includes the first 200-words or so issued in the pre-released statement.

- Paper 1 has a qualitative focus, although there is the possibility that minor calculations can be included in the exam.

- A 4-function calculator is permitted in Paper 1. This is because there may be minor calculations included in the questions, such as in the May 2024 Paper 1 examination (Before One PLC).

- All answers are to be written on separate answer sheets (unlike Paper 2). Candidates are provided with 2 four-page booklets for this examination.
