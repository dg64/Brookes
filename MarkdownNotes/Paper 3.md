Paper 3
========================

## The Paper 3 exam

Paper 3 (HL only) exam, with a duration of 1 hour and 15 minutes, is based on unseen stimulus material about a social enterprise. The purpose is to assess important business management knowledge and skills (such as strategic analysis and evaluation) within the context of a social enterprise as a business entity.  Paper 3 is forward-looking,  providing students the opportunity to develop and demonstrate their problem solving abilities and decision making skills.

The rationale for the specific focus on social enterprises is in line with the objectives of the new course (to enable students to develop as confident,  creative and compassionate business leaders,  entrepreneurs,  social entrepreneurs and as change agents, page 17 of the guide).  It also aligns well with the CAS programme as well as the IB mission statement.

In this paper,  students will act as change agents using an **ethical** and **creative** lens to solve significant strategic challenges facing a social enterprise in a **sustainable** way.

The exam paper is strategic in scope so any of the **BMT** could be used to recommend an appropriate plan of action, e.g.,  SWOT analysis,  STEEPLE analysis,  Ansoff matrix,  BCG matrix,  and Porters’ generic strategies.

## What is a social enterprise?

Social enterprises are an example of social purpose organizations (SPOs).  Essentially,  they aim to primarily provide a solution to important social or environmental issues. They exist to to create a better world due to the role they play to improve society overall.  As they are not always revenue-generating,  SPOs often need financial funding and suitable human resources.  Other SPOs include charities,  cooperatives,  and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

Definitions of social enterprises include the following:

- "a business entity that aims to achieve a social or environmental mission while also generating revenue. It combines the principles of traditional business with a focus on addressing social or environmental issues." (**Social Enterprise UK**)
- "businesses that put the interests of people and planet ahead of shareholder gain.  These businesses are driven by a social/environmental mission and reinvest profits into creating positive social change." (**Social Enterprise Mark**)
- "combine societal goals with an entrepreneurial spirit (and) focus on achieving wider social, environmental,  or community objectives." (**European Commission**)
- "a business with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or in the community, rather than being driven by the need to maximise profit for shareholders and owners." (**Gov.uk**)

Whilst there are several competing definitions,  unlike traditional for-profit businesses,  social enterprises combine social and commercial agendas in order to achieve their social,  developmental,  and environmental agenda. Their activities,  by definition,  are driven by and create social benefits.

Types of social enterprise explicitly featured in the IB Business Management syllabus:

- **For-profit social enterprises** (AO3): (i) Private sector companies, (ii) Public sector companies, and (iii) Cooperatives.

- **Non-profit social enterprises** (AO3): (iv) Non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

Note that social enterprises can,  and often are,  for-profit organizations.  However,  the difference is their existence (or social purpose) is beyond profitability as its very existence generates social benefits.  In other words, profit follows as a consequence of its social and environmental goals,  rather than as a result of its commercial activities.

### Table 1 - Differences between charities, social enterprises, and traditional (for-profit) businesses

| Charities |  Social enterprises | Traditional businesses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mission driven (charitable mission) | Purpose driven (social purpose) | Vision driven (commercial vision) |
| Funded by donations, grants, and fundraising | Funded by internal and external sources, including sales revenue | Funded by owners, investors, and internal and external sources |
| Surplus reinvested | Significant portion of profits reinvested* | Profits mainly distributed to owners (shareholders) |
| Purely charitable | Focus on social benefits | Corporate social responsibility (CSR) |
| Non-profit organizations | Can be for-profit, non-profit, or NGO | For-profit organizations |
| Focus on societal gains (public benefits) | Focus on social and environment impact plus profit generation | Focus on financial returns (shareholder value) |
| No individual ownership, but governed by a board | Can be owned by individuals, non-profits, or trusts | Owned by individuals, partnerships, or shareholders |
| Tax exempt | May have tax benefits depending on legal structure | Taxable business entities, subject to corporate taxes |


According to **Social Enterprise UK**,  social enterprises reinvest or donate at least half of any profits they earn to further their social or environmental mission.

Social enterprises have three main sustainable business objectives, commonly referred to as ‘the triple bottom line’. The triple bottom line, a business management model developed by John Elkington (b.1949), comprises of the following:

- **Economic sustainability** (profit) - to earn a profit to fund its activities and growth in a sustainable way.

- **Social or cultural sustainability** (people) - to provide social gains for members of local communities, such as providing job opportunities and support for less-privileged members of society.

- **Environmental sustainability** (planet) - to manage and operate the business in such a way as to protect the ecological (natural) environment, i.e., behaving in an environmentally sustainable and responsible manner.

So,  in addition to striving to earn a profit or financial surplus,  social enterprises are driven foremost by social and/or environmental objectives and socially responsible practices.  Some examples of these are outlined in Table 2 below.

### Table 2 - Examples of social and environmental sustainable practices

| Social (cultural) sustainability practices | Environmental (ecological) sustainability practices |
| --- | --- |
| Social enterprises being led by women | Fair trade practices |
| Diversity in management representation | Business practices that address climate change |
| Paying employees fair and decent wages | Circular business models |
| Operating in the most deprived communities | Transparency in approaches to environmental protection |
| Driven by an authentic social mission | Driven by an authentic environmental mission |

Adding a third paper for HL means reducing the time needed for the other papers, previously 2 hours 15 minutes each.
The stimulus material in Paper 3 will typically consist of:

- a short introduction to the social enterprise.

- a visual representation of a product.

- about 5 or 6 excerpts from various documents (such as emails, social media feeds, infographics, and newspaper articles).

Students need to answer the one compulsory structured set of questions based on the unseen stimulus material.  This paper is worth 25 mark in in total.

Note that a calculator is permitted for this examination paper. This is because there may be quantitative data included in stimulus material, such as in the May 2024 Paper 3 examination (gearing ratio and debtor days ratio for MF Future Housing). All calculations in Business Management exams can be completed using a 4-function calculator.

Candidates are provided with 2 four-page booklets to write their answers for this examination.

The Paper 3 examination requires students to do three main things:

1. Identify and describe a **human need** (worth 2 marks)

2. Explain the potential **organizational challenges** facing the social entrepreneur wanting to meet this need (worth 6 marks), and

3. Write a decision-making document that consists of a business **recommendation** or strategic "plan of action" (worth 17 marks).

Note that all five units of the syllabus can be assessed (Units 1 - 5), including HL extension topics.

This also applies to the Business Management Toolkit (BMT).

The overall weighting of Paper 3 (HL only) is 25%.

Paper 3 (HL only) answers are to be written on separate answer sheets (as with Paper 1, but unlike Paper 2).

## Question 1 - Human needs (2 marks)

For Question 1 of Paper 3,  students need to be able to identify and describe an example of a human need. This can include consideration of:

- Maslow’s hierarchy of needs

- McClelland’s theory of needs

- UNDP's Sustainable Development Goals and human needs

- Ecological, Economic, and Social (Cultural) sustainability needs, i.e., Elkington's triple bottom line

- Stakeholder needs

## Question 2 - Organizational challenges (6 marks)

For Question 2 of Paper 3, students must also be able to explain the potential organizational challenges or threats facing the social entrepreneur wanting to meet the human need that is identified and described in Question 1.  Examples of organizational challenges include:

- SWOT analysis (BMT)

- STEEPLE analysis (BMT), e.g., competition

- Hofstede's cultural dimensions (BMT)

- Human resources challenges

- Sustainability challenges

- Financial resources, e.g., liquidity and budgeting

- Marketing challenges

- Operations management challenges

- Leadership and management challenges

- Change and resistance to change


## Question 3 - The plan of action (17 marks)

For Question 3,  the final section of Paper 3,  students are required to write a decision-making document that includes business recommendations or a plan of action.  This extended response question is worth 17 marks (that's not a typo!)

Question 3 is a synoptic assessment,  evaluating a candidate's ability to understand and integrate the connections between various elements of Business Management.  It is designed to encourage a comprehensive and holistic understanding of a social enterprise, including its challenges and opportunities. 

> Adapted from What is synoptic assessment? Filio Constantinou, Assessment in education,  principles policy and practice Vol 27 2020

> Paper 3 is a synoptic assessment task and asks the candidate:

> to draw different business management ideas together and synthesize information.

> to make a clear and coherent argument and justification for an organization (social enterprise) to pursue a sustainable plan over a period of five years.

> to apply appropriate tools and theories to support arguments.

> to structure the response clearly, with ideas and analysis sequenced in a coherent manner to effectively utilize all the resource materials included.

> Source: May 2024 Paper 3 (HL only) mark scheme, page 5

There are four assessment criteria for the extended response question in Question 3:

1. Criterion A - Use of resource materials (worth 4 marks)

2. Criterion B - Business management tools and theories (worth 4 marks)

3. Criterion C - Evaluation (worth 6 marks)

4. Criterion D - Sequencing of ideas and plan of action (worth 3 marks).

## Plan of action

Note that a plan of action is not a single strategy used in isolation.  An action plan (or strategic plan) will have numerous elements to it,  i.e.,  it is essentially a **business plan**.  Therefore, a well-designed plan of action may include relevant aspects of the following (depending on the specific case study in question):

| Element of action plan | Description | Examples of content |
| ---| ---| ---|
| Human resource action plan | A well-designed human resource plan of action is crucial for the success of any organization as it helps to attract and retain the best employees, enhance their performance, and ultimately contribute to the achievement of the social enterprise's corporate objectives. | - Workforce planning<br>- Recruitment and selection<br>- Training and development<br>- Retention strategies<br>- Performance management (staff appraisals)<br>- Financial and non-financial motivation<br>- Motivation theory<br>- Diversity and inclusion policies.  |
| Marketing action plan | A well-designed marketing action plan is critical for the success of any business, as it helps the organization to reach and engage with customers, differentiate their products  from those offered by competitors, and ultimately drive sales revenue and growth. | - Marketing objectives<br>- Marketing planning<br>- Market research<br>- Segmentation, targeting, and positioning (STP)<br>- Sales forecasting<br>- The marketing mix<br>- Marketing budgets<br>- International marketing strategies. |
| Operations management action plan | A well-designed operations management action plan is vital for the functioning and performance of a business as it helps to ensure that goods and/or services are produced efficiently and with consistent quality,  while minimizing waste and reducing production costs. | - Capacity and capacity utilization<br>- Quality management<br>- Inventory management (stock control)<br>- Local and global supply chain management<br>- Research and development (R&D)<br>- Contingency planning<br>- Management information systems (MIS). |
| Financial action plan | A well-designed finance action plan is important for the success of any business as no strategy can be executed without the necessary funds. The plan helps to ensure that the business considers the necessary financial resources to operate, grow, and make strategic decisions, while managing financial risks and providing stakeholders with transparent and accurate financial information. | - Capital expenditure<br>- Costs and revenues (including revenue streams)<br>- Sources of finance<br>- Financial analysis (including ratio analysis)<br>- Investment appraisal<br>- Budgeting (including variance analysis)<br>- Cash flow management. |

Any plan of action must align with the social enterprise's mission or vision - so look out for indications of these in the stimulus material.

Your plan of action should not only address the current issues faced by the social enterprise (the two challenges identified in Question 2), but must provide solutions for the future in terms of the organization's sustainability, profitability (financial health), and competitiveness.

Tackle the two challenges faced by the social enterprise explained in Question 2. Thereafter, present the longer-term plan of action (Years 3 to 5), which will have a positive long-term impact on the social enterprise.
