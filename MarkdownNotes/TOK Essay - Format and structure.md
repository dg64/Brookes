TOK Essay - Format and structure
========================

A TOK essay should include the following: **the introduction, 1st Area of Knowledge, 2nd Area of Knowledge, and the conclusion.** The AOK sections should be subdivided and contain both arguments and counterarguments relating to the area under study. The word count cannot exceed 1,600 words.

## Introduction
Start your TOK essay with a short introductory section. Here, you'll introduce the prescribed title, clarify essential terms relevant to your investigation, and provide a brief overview of your strategy for addressing the research. Choosing the right prompt from the list of prescribed titles is crucial, so take some time. Don't settle on the easiest title, think of interesting examples to support your analysis and various perspectives that you can include. 

## First area of knowledge
In your TOK Essay, you must analyse 2 Areas of Knowledge. Sometimes you have full independence, while in other cases one AOK is already stated. After having chosen the fields that will be subject to your study, move on to their analysis.

Each Area of Knowledge should be approached from **2 contrary perspectives**. Therefore we suggest dividing it into 2 paragraphs. First, **state a claim** in reference to the chosen prescribed title and use examples from an appropriate subject to support it. Clearly describe what is the relation between the prompt and the example. Next, you are expected to present an opposing view. Again you must base your **counterclaim** on real-life cases making references to the analysed Area of Knowledge. Finally, balance the presented evidence and briefly conclude your view on the topic in relation to this AOK. 

## Second area of knowledge
Analogically, you should investigate the second Area of Knowledge in the context of the prescribed research question. Repeat the structure: 

1. **first argument** - state a claim concerning the title 

2. **a real-life example drawn from the AOK** - present an example from the analysed field of study that will support your argument 

3. **explanation** - clearly explain how the described case reflects on the study 

4. **second argument (counterargument)** - state an argument with a contrary view 

5. **a real-life example drawn from the analysed AOK** - relate to objects, theories, history, events, or developments from this Area of Knowledge. 

6. **explanation** - use the example to support the second argument

7.  **brief summary** - present the key takeaways from the analysis 

## Conclusion
After having presented the various perspectives on the topic, summarize your view in the conclusion. In this section, you'll conclude your investigation and respond to the research question. Highlight the key findings. You should also emphasize the importance of investigating this subject and suggest potential avenues for expanding upon your research.

## TOK Essay Tips
Remember about the maximum **word count** and proper allocation of words between the sections. We recommend the following distribution to write a balanced essay: 

- Introduction - around 150 words 

- First Area of Knowledge - 2 x 300 words 

- Second Area of Knowledge - 2 x 300 words 

- Conclusion - around 250 words 

Also, keep in mind the **assessment criteria**: 

- Throughout the entire essay keep focus on the title and make strong connections to the Areas of Knowledge. 

- Make sure to acknowledge different perspectives while examining the 2 AOKs. 

- Keep the essay critical and argumentative. 

- Maintain a logical structure. 

- The arguments should be logical and well-supported with concrete examples.

- Provide justifications and explanations where necessary.
