Cost to Buy (CTB) and Cost to Make (CTM)
========================

A **make or buy** decision involves managers choosing whether to manufacture a product in-house (make) or to purchase it (buy) from a third-party subcontractor.  A make or buy decision is therefore about the relative benefits or gains of insourcing compared with those of outsourcing production.

In-house production enables the organization to have closer control over costs and quality.  It also allows the business to have better overall management of the production process. However,  using third party suppliers (subcontractors) can create flexibility and capacity for the business, such as dealing with unexpected fluctuations in the level of demand. Subcontractors may also be more productive and cost-effective.

There are two straightforward quantitative techniques that can be used when businesses decide whether to make or buy.  These methods are called the “**cost to make**” and “**cost to buy**”.  The cost to buy (CTB) refers to the total cost of subcontracting production to a third-party supplier,  i.e.,  the cost of outsourcing production.  By contrast,  the cost to make (CTM) refers to the total costs of producing a good or service in-house.  i.e.,  the cost of producing the product internally rather than outsourcing.

In general, the following rules apply based on quantitative reasoning:

- If the CTM > CTB, the firm should use outsourcing or subcontracting.

- If the CTB > CTM, the firm should use insourcing (in-house production).

## Cost to Buy

The cost to buy (CTB) method calculates the total cost of subcontracting production to a third-party supplier.

For example,  some of the world’s largest electronics companies subcontract production to Foxconn,  located in Shenzhen,  China.  Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer.  The multinational company, headquarted in Taiwan,  makes products for its corporate clients that include: Apple (iPad and iPhone),  Amazon (Kindle),  Nintendo (Wii U),  Sony (PlayStation),  and Microsoft (Xbox One).

As a customer,  the cost to buy (CTB) a product from a supplier is calculated by using the formula:

```
    Cost to buy (CTB) = Price × Quantity
```

or

```
    CTB = P × Q
```

The CTB method in a make or buy decision allows a business to calculate the total cost of outsourcing production.  If the cost to buy is less than the cost to make (CTB < CTM),  then it makes financial sense for the firm to purchase the product from a third party provider,  rather than making it in-house. It can then resell the product and earn higher profit margins.

## Cost to Make

In a make or buy decision,  managers calculate the costs of making a product compared to the overall cost of buying the product from a supplier instead.  The cost to make (CTM) refers to the total costs of producing a good or service in-house,  rather than using a third-party supplier.  The CTM a good or service in-house is calculated by using the formula:

```
    Cost to make (CTM) = Total costs of production = Total fixed costs + Total variable costs
```

or

```
    CTM = TFC + TVC 
```

Consider the example below:

A hotel is considering whether to make or buy 3,000 luxury cupcakes for a special function.  It can make these for a variable cost per unit of $4.50 per cupcake,  and would allocate $4,500 in fixed costs to this order.  Alternatively,  the hotel can buy the cupcakes from a reputable supplier at a price of $7.0 per cupcake,  less 10% discount for the bulk order.  In this particular example:

- The hotel’s CTM = $4,500 + ($4.50 × 3,000) = $18,000

- The hotel’s CTB = ($7.0 × 0.9) × 3,000 = $18,900

Hence,  it is cheaper for the hotel to make the cupcakes rather than using the specialist supplier (unless it can offer a discounted price of less than $6.0).

In reality,  managers consider both qualitative and quantitative factors before making a final decision to make or buy. Examples of qualitative factors include consideration of the reputation of the third-party provider,  lead times for deliveries, and the capacity of employees if in-house production is preferred.

### Advantages of cost to buy and cost to make decisions

- Cost efficiency - Outsourcing certain goods or services (if the CTB < CTM) can often be more cost-effective than producing them in-house,  especially when the external provider has specialized expertise or significant **economies of scale.**

- Focus on core competencies - By outsourcing non-core activities (if the CTB < CTM),  a business can concentrate on its core competencies,  improving overall efficiency and competitiveness in its main business areas.

- Flexibility - If the CTM < CTB,  in-house production will allow the business to have more control over the production process.  However,  if the CTB < CTM,  buying from a third-party provider will give the business more flexibility to adapt quickly to changes in market conditions or technology without having to make any major internal changes.

- Access to expertise - Buying goods or services from specialized suppliers (if the CTB < CTM) can provide access to market expertise and technologies that might be too expensive or inaccessible to develop in-house.

- Risk sharing - Sharing the production risk with external suppliers can be advantageous for a business.  For example,  if there are fluctuations in demand or unforeseen challenges,  the outsourced provider shares in the responsibility and challenges.

### Disdvantages of cost to buy and cost to make decisions

- Loss of control - Outsourcing (if the CTB < CTM) can lead to a loss of control over the production process,  quality standards,  and production timelines.  The dependence on external suppliers may introduce greater uncertainties and risks for the business.

- Quality concerns - Similarly,  the quality of externally sourced goods or services (if the CTB < CTM) may not always meet the internal standards of the organization,  leading to potential issues with the final good or service delivered to consumers.

- Dependency on suppliers - Relying on external suppliers introduces a level of dependency and risk.  For example, disruptions in the **supply chain process** can have a significant impact on the organization's operations.

- Confidentiality risks - Sharing sensitive information and potential trade secrets with external suppliers may pose data and confidentiality risks.  Protecting **intellectual property** (IP) can also become a challenge when involving third parties.

- Long-term cost issues - While outsourcing may seem cost-effective initially (as the CTB < CTM),  long-term costs associated with this decision can offset the initial savings and lead to higher overall expenses.  Such costs include transportation, communications,  and coordination.
