Capacity utilization rate
========================

**Capacity utilization** refers to the extent to which an organization operates at its maximum level (known as the firm’s productive capacity).  The **capacity utilization rate** measures the organization’s actual output as a percentage of its capacity (maximum potential output), at a particular point in time.

The capacity utilization rate is calculated using the formula:

```
    Capacity utilization = (Actual output per period / Full capacity output per period) × 100
```
A firm with 0% capacity utilization means it is not producing any output.  Hence,  there is a lot of spare capacity.  By contrast, a firm that has 100% capacity utilization means it is operating at full capacity,  with all of its resources being used.

As an example,  suppose that a producer has the capacity to operate for up to twelve hours per day during a five-day working week.  This means the maximum number of hours it can operate (the capacity) is 12 × 5 = 60 hours per week.  So,  if it is operational for 45 hours during a given week,  the producer's capacity utilization rate is (45 / 60) × 100 = 75%.  This tells managers that the firm was working at only three quarters of its maximum capacity.

As a real-world example,  the capacity at Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium is 60,432.  If on a match day the football club sells 54,389 tickets,  this means the organization has a capacity utilization rate of 90% (i.e., 54,389 expressed as a percentage of 60,432).

Capacity utilization is used as an indicator of productive efficiency as it measures the extent to which an organization is operating at its maximum level.  For instance, when workers are required to work overtime,  the capacity utilization rate rises. Capacity utilization is likely to fall when the level of demand falls or when there are insufficient resources to operate at a high level.

### Advantages of high capacity utilization

- In general,  higher capacity utilization is required to achieve economies of scale. Average costs of production tend to fall when the level of output rises.  So,  as the capacity utilization rate increases there are more opportunities to experience economies of scale.

- Hence,  higher capacity utilization can help to reduce a firm’s unit costs,  making it more competitive.

- Lower average costs of production from economies of scale is also likely to lead to higher profits for the business.

- Higher capacity utilization also means the firm is more productively efficient,  as it makes the most out of the use of its resources.  By contrast,  if capacity utilization is low,  resources are idle.

### Disadvantages of high capacity utilization

- Workers can become overworked, so become exhausted, stressed and demotivated as they work flat out.

- Machinery and capital equipment are likely to become wear out and depreciate at a fast pace. T his can result in higher costs for maintenance and replacement or repairs.

- Improving capacity utilization may involve upgrading IT systems and technologies. However, this can be extremely costly.

- As workers focus on the quantity or volume of output, it is possible that the overall quality will suffer.
