The local and global supply chain process
========================

A **supply chain** refers to the network of the individuals, firms, resources, business operations, and technologies involved in the creation and sale of a particular good.  **Supply chain management (SCM)** is the art of managing and controlling the sequence of activities from the production of a product to it being delivered to the final customer.  SCM is about planning and organizing production as well as the distribution of finished goods. It includes overseeing the movement and storage of raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods,  from the point of origin to the point of consumption of the final product.

For example, the supply chain for shirts includes the following:

- Cloth manufacturer

- Tailor or producer

- Distribution and transportation

- Retailers

- Customers.

Supply chain management involves a firm working with all its suppliers in order to maximize efficiency, be they locally and/or globally based.  The logistics involved must also be cost effective for the business to be profitable.

By contrast,  a long supply chain or ineffective supply chain management can be costly to an organization . This is because it increases the odds of things going wrong,  such as miscommunications with suppliers in the chain or late deliveries being made.

A **local supply chain** refers to short distances between producers,  suppliers, and consumers within a confined location,  such as the same city,  district,  or country.  For example,  a local farmer may supply organically grown agricultural produce to customers in nearby locations.  Local supply chains can be more efficient in terms of time and involves less transportation. This has positive impact on the economy and environment,  such as less pollution and shorter supply chains.  Furthermore, local supply chains are less prone to disruptions and tend to be more sustainable than global supply chains.

A **global supply chain** refers to the network between a firm and its suppliers and consumers that incorporates all transactions on an international level, from sourcing raw materials to supplying finished goods and services to customers.  It involves the long distances between producers, suppliers,  and consumers across different countries.  Hence,  this involves the international trade of goods and services.  For example, supermarkets import fruits and vegetables grown in other countries and continents.  These products will have been harvested and packaged ready for  transportation over hundred or thousands of miles across international borders.

Global supply chains can be more efficient in terms of costs due to the benefits of offshoring production. However, they have a bigger impact on the environment and tend to be less sustainable than local supply chains. Nevertheless, the benefits of international trade and exchange mean the multinational companies rely on global supply chains to increase their customer base and profits.

Effective SCM has become increasingly important and more complex due to changing consumer demands and information being more readily available on the Internet and social media platforms. This is one reasons why reshoring has becoming more popular as businesses shift production back to the domestic economy due to growing concerns about risks of long and complex supply chains as well as global supply chains being disrupted by unpredictable events around the world. The dangers of ineffective supply chain management can have devastating impacts on an organization (such as KFC running out of chicken products in the UK back in 2018)
