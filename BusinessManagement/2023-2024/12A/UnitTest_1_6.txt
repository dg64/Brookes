Question 2	4/4

Question 3	0/4
		You used the wrong perspective. You were mean to talk about the implication
		for consumer of steel, not for Tata
		Jagar and Land Rover will experience lower prices, as they are part of Tata;
		other car manufacturers can experience the opposite effect, as Tata now can
		control the price of the steel on the market.

Question 4	7/10
		You do not get the full score because you mentioned among the benefit, the
		economies of scale. Once again, this is from the perspective of the business,
		while the question was about the consumers.
