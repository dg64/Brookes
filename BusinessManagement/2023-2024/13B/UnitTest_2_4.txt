Questio 2	2/2
		An increase in salary is not always granted. Often it is a bonus

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	1/2
		Performance Related Pay is paid on top of the salary for excellent performances.
		The employee receives his salary in any case

Question 3	2/6
		The cut in salary will drop motivation, but you can not tie this with Maslow. According
		to Maslow, money is not a motivator. You could have used Maslow referring at the need of
		self-esteem satisfied by the perks (company car); the appraisal system could have been
		associated with the motivator factors of Herzberg and the PRP schema, with the Vroom
		expectancy theory or Adam equity theory.

Question 4	3/10
		In this answer you are mixing theories and payment schemas. PRP does not mean getting paid
		more for working more; it is about bringing extra value to the company; achieve exceptional
		results. This achievement is rewarded, usually, with a bonus on top of the salary.
		You mentioned Herzberg without linking his theory to the case study (Motivator, related to
		the appraisal system and the feedback); hygiene - the bonus paid for above nornal performance).

		Performance Related Pay is paid on top of the salary for excellent performances.
		The employee receives his salary in any case

Question 3	2/6
		The basic needs in the Maslow theory are only the first two (survival and safety).
		Consultnats can not manage themselves their salary; this information is nowhere to
		be found in the case study

Question 4	3/10
		Insufficient answer for a question worth 10 point.
		You were expected to provide two advantages and two disadvantages; to link motivational
		theories to the case study; to provide explanatory examples.
