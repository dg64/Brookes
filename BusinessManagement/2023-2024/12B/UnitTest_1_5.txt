Question 2	0/4
		The calculation where meant to be done for the 15000 jeans sold

Question 3	4/4

		The question was about costs, not about external factors; potential
		additional costs for importing jeans can be: shipping costs,
		import tax.

Question 5	2/6
		You made a good point about the competitive advantage.
		There are two flaws in your analysis:
		- lowering sales is meaningless; why would the company do that?
		- Why would the American company stop to supply JKL?

Question 1	2/2
		Please do not use the word "money"

Question 2	0/4
		Calculation incorrect

Question 3	2/4
		I assume that you misspelled the word; according to your statement an increase in exchange rate
		leads to a loss. It is the opposite. Instead of increase and decrease, use the terms
		appreciation and depreciation

Question 4	0/4
		Tax do not give profit.
		Storage cost are not related with import.
		Import tax.
		Shipping costs

Question 5	2/6
		You need to revise this topic. The exchange rate is not something that the business can set;
		you keep using the word money and the terms increase and decrease instead of appreciation and
		depreciation. 
		A high exchange rate might have a negative influence on the level of exports, causing a decrease
		of demand, a decrease of workforce needed and ultimately, a decrease of disposable income.

Question 1	1/2
		a currency; not a value

Question 2	0/4
		The values were supposed to be calculated for the 15000 jeans

Question 3	4/4

Question 4	2/4
		Import tax

Question 5	0/6
		Do you assume that a strong currency is unstable?
		Beside the obvious threat of fluctuations in the exchange rate; a high exchange rate might push
		JKL to buy more jeans and creates a surplus a demand that, ultimately, will lead in a 
		decrease of price. A strong currency might also push customers to look for the some product
		in cheaper markets.

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	0/4
		The values were supposed to be calculated for the 15000 jeans

Question 3	1/4
		What does it mean "the profit or loss increases"?
		"decrease by the numbers of the price"??

Question 4	2/4
		Import tax

Question 5	2/6
		There is no increase in price and there is no guarantee that with an increase in price JKL
		will maintain the same level of sales, moreover we do not know about the price elasticity
		of demand of that particular product.
		Your observation about competitiveness with other markets (the ones with a weaker currency 
		- that you did not mention); but the reason for that, again, is incorrect; there is no
		increase in price from JKL
