SLADEWSKA MARLENA
********************************************************************************
Marlena joined the class only this year, but since the beginning of the term, she has distinguished herself for his behaviour and his performance. Marlena is a well-mannered student who has found no problem bonding with her classmates. During the class debates and summative assessments, her answers show a clear understanding of the topics studied; her analysis is balanced and well explained; the business management terms are always used appropriately. Marlena is an active member of the class; she participates in the class debates and poses questions that show both her interest and her inquirer attitude.
The result of his mock exam confirms her excellent results: 7 for both the mock and the current attainment. Marlena’s attendance is attested to 100%.
Recommendation: focus on the analysis and the connection with the syllabus in the Paper 2 / Section C question.

ANNA KONOVALOVA
********************************************************************************
Anna closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 45 out of 70 points. Anna’s attendance is attested to 98.04%.
Anna shows a good understanding of the topics covered; her analysis is balanced and supported by examples; stimulus materials are referenced and business management terms are used appropriately.
The criteria for grading the mock exams are more relaxed, compared to the criteria used to grade the summative assessment; this allowed Anna to receive a 7, even though she answered only one of the two questions required from Section B. Anna needs to be more careful in reading both the instruction and the content of the questions because a small disattention can cost her precious points.
Recommendation: Work on Paper 2 / Section C type questions; practice with different test cases and their connections with the syllabus.

ELIZAVETA SVITOVA
********************************************************************************
Anna closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 56 out of 70 points. Anna’s attendance is attested to 90.20%.
Despite the less-than-ideal level of attendance, Elizaveta was always able to keep pace and recover from the missed lessons and the missed summative assessments. Elizaveta shows a good understanding of the topics covered; her analysis is balanced and supported by examples; stimulus materials are referenced and business management terms are used appropriately.
Elizaveta actively participates in class debates and she always checks her understanding with questions for me or with a comparison of her answer with the ones of her peers.
Recommendation: Work on Paper 2 / Section C type questions; for the exam, she chose a good test case but lost the chance to make some good links with the syllabus.


********************************************************************************
STEPHAN VESSELOV
********************************************************************************
Stephan closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 44 out of 50 points. Stephan's attendance is attested to 98.04%.
Stephan continues the trend that started in the second part of the last year; his assessments are always graded with the maximum score. By his own statement, he set for himself the target of excelling in Business Management. I am personally pleased and proud of such a display of commitment and consistency of behaviour through time.
Stephan’s answers are well-structured and easy to read; the analysis is always well-balanced and supported by stimulus material.  The correct use of business management terms also shows a good understanding of the topics covered.
Recommendation: Work on Paper 2 / Section C type questions; refine the analysis of his own portfolio of test cases.


********************************************************************************
ZHIRUI TAN
********************************************************************************
Zhirui closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 66 out of 70 points. Zhirui’s attendance is attested to 80.39%
This low level of attendance is due to the fact that Zhirui is currently on provisional learning. Luckily, this less-than-ideal regime did not prevent Zhirui to maintain his level of performance; his 7s, both in the mock exam and in his summative assessments are sound ones. Zhirui has good analytical skills, especially what concerns numerical analysis; he has a gift for understanding figures and their meaning. This gift allows Zhirui to make analysis in which his arguments are always well supported and proven; the same approach is used in the formulation of the conclusion with his own judgement 
Recommendation: Work on Paper 2 / Section C type questions; refine the analysis of his own portfolio of test cases and the possible connections with the syllabus.


********************************************************************************
ILYA CHERNOY
********************************************************************************
Ilya closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 57 out of 70 points. Ilya's attendance is attested to 94.23%.
Ilya has improved since the previous year. Not only your answer are well constructed and clear to read; but he also improved his analytical and evaluation skills; the business management terms are used correctly and in the right context; this testifies to his understanding of the topics covered so far in Business Management. 
Recommendation: Ilya need to work on the Paper 2 / Section C questions; when it comes to providing a test case and linking it to the syllabus, Ilya shows still some difficulties to identify all the possible connections.


********************************************************************************
ANASTASIA ARTOMONOVA
********************************************************************************
Anastasia closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 60 out of 70 points. Anastasia's attendance is attested to 100%.
Since the beginning of the year, Anastasia has shown a steady improvement; her first summative assessment scored with a 5, but this was not enough for her and she worked hard to reach immediately the top score. Despite the great result in the mock exam, there is also evidence of some misunderstanding of topics that Anastasia should have studied the previous year; for this reason, Anastasia, must read carefully the feedback and revise the topics highlighted in my comment. Another problem that Anastasia should address immediately is her handwriting; her answers are well structured and her analysis is balanced, but they are very difficult to read. An examiner could give up reading or misunderstand Anatasia’s handwriting; better to play safe.
Recommendation: Revise the topics highlighted in the mock feedback and improve your handwriting.


********************************************************************************
Paetur Jacobsen
********************************************************************************
Paetur closes the first term with current attainment of 3 and a score of 4 for the Mock exam, with 30 out of 70 points. Paetur's attendance is attested to 98.08%.
The current attainment is brought down by grades of the first summative assessments, which were not satisfactory; however, Paetur managed to improve, and I am confident that this process is not ended yet. In the mock exam, Paetur has shown an ability to express knowledge and understanding in terminology specific to the subject; some ability to develop ideas and substantiate assertions; use of knowledge and understanding which is more descriptive than analytical.
Recommendation: Paetur need to work hard on his analytical and evaluative skills; at the same time, he should start revising the topics for which, in the mock exam, he did not get the full score.






********************************************************************************
ELDAR ASADOV
********************************************************************************
Eldar closes the first term with current attainment of 5 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 48 out of 70 points. Eldar’s attendance is attested to 80.7%
This low level of attendance is due to the fact that Eldar was on provisional learning until a few days ago.
The difference between the current attainment and the score of the mock exam can be partially explained by the “relaxed” grade boundaries and partially by the improvement shown by Eldar. In his answer, Eldar shows an ability to integrate knowledge and concepts and a tendency to be more descriptive than evaluative; he still has some problems with the structure of the answers, since sometimes he forgets to provide a conclusion with his own judgment, as a closure of the analysis.
Recommendation: Eldar should prioritize the revision of the requirements in writing the answers (balanced and with a conclusion); as a next step Eldar should work on his analytical skills.






********************************************************************************
ARTEM KHANZIN
********************************************************************************
Artem closes the first term with current attainment of 3 and a score of 5 for the Mock exam, with 21 out of 50 points. Artem’s attendance is attested to 96.15%
The difference between the current attainment and the score of the mock exam can be partially explained by the “relaxed” grade boundaries and partially by the improvement shown by Artem. He paid the price of joining the school during the late previous academic year; Artem has a lot to recover and a lot of work ahead of him, to secure his position. 
In his answers, Artem shows basic use of terminology and some ability to establish links between facts or ideas; there is also evidence of comprehension of data and problems. Artem is still not familiar with the requirements for answering the questions in Business Management and this is something that he should address in the first place.
Recommendation: revise the requirement for providing a balanced answer, with a conclusion and his own judgement; as a second step Artem must revise the topics for which he did not get the full score during the mock exam.


********************************************************************************
AKHIL SINGH
********************************************************************************
Akhil closes the first term with current attainment of 5 and a score of 7 for the Mock exam, with 52 out of 70 points. Artem’s attendance is attested to 100%
Akhil started well the year then, for some reason, he had a period of low performance which, luckily, was only temporary. In his answers, Akhil shows detailed knowledge and understanding, the ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize knowledge and concepts. The structure of the answer, on the other hand, needs to be revised; Akhil provides balanced answers, but the advantages and disadvantages presented in his analysis are not clearly organized and require two or more re-reading to be sure that the answer is correctly balanced. I must also say that not all his answers suffer from this lack of organization.
Recommendation: consolidate the skill of writing clear and structured answers; practice the connection between test cases with tools and strategies, required in the Paper 2 / Section C question.

MATVEY AKHMETOV
********************************************************************************
Matvey made limited progress since the beginning of the year. The current attainment for this term is 2, while the mock exam is graded 3, with 24 out of 70 points. His attendance in Business Management is 88.46%.
In his works, Matvey shows a limited knowledge and understanding of the subject; some sense of structure in the answers; a limited use of terminology appropriate to the subject; a limited ability to establish links between facts or ideas. What concerns me is the low level of attendance; Matvey already joined Brookes with small gaps in his knowledge about the syllabus and his prolonged absences in this first term, do not help him. Matvey is currently receiving additional lessons in Business Management, but unfortunately, also for these additional lessons, his attendance is sporadic; he comes too seldom to formulate a plan of recovery.
Recommendation: usually here I should suggest the best course of action for the next term; in the case of Matvey I can only suggest that he revise his priorities.
