Question 4      1/6
                I told you to keep in mind the business of JKL
                JIT is not suitable for a retail business
                Creditors and Debtors have already improved

Question 5      3/6 
                You discarded the trend analysis of the Gearing ratio.
                The gearing decreased because the liabilities did not
                change, while the shareholders increased the capital
                invested.

                I told you to keep in mind the business of JKL
                JIT is not suitable for a retail business

Question 5      1/6
                Your analysis of the gearing ratio is incorrect.
                The company has already increased the equity from
                one year to another and you discarded this information.
                JKL did not decrease the amount of long term liabilities
                but with use of more equity, has changed the gearing
                ratio.
                As for the inventory turnover .. read the previous
                comment
