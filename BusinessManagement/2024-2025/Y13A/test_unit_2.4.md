Question 3      4/4

Question 4      8/10
                Good that you referenced Maslow and Herzberg.
                Too bad that your Maslow's understanding is

                the hygiene factors.

                incorrect

                There is no reference to motivational theories.
                Also, I do not see how the PRP can generate competition

                different customer
