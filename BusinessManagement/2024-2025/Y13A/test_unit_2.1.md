Question 2      4/4

Question 3      1/4
                The training and the career opportunity are not necesseraly related,

                Revise the chapter

Question 2      0/4
                Same as above

Question 3      2/4
                You did not completely answer the question.
                Do you think that simply choosing to hire already trained
                people will solve the problem? Where will you find those
                people if the general attitude of hoteliers is not to
                provide any professional development?
                You need to carefully read the text of the case study

Question 4      7/10
                Same as above. Where these new idea will come from if the
                general attitude is to just exploit workers?
