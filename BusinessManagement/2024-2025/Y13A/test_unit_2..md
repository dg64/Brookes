## Alice

Question 1      2/2
                You missed an important quality of a leader: inspiring

Question 2      4/4

Question 3      2/4
                You need to revise the difference between manager and leader.
                Your understanding is incorrect

Question 4      6/10
                When you mention problem relarted with to the collective decision-
                making process, you need to specify them. Beside that, the collective
                decision-making process is a feature of cooperatives, not of a 
                democratic leader; also, you define as minus the very basis of the
                democratic process.
                Situational leadership is not mean to improve motivation, but to
                manager effectively and at the same time, different types of people.

Quesiton 3      1/4
                You mixed up Leaders and Managers

Question 4      5/10
                Laissez-faire is totaly inappropriate for a school. 
                Situational leadership style can crate more problems
                of what it solves.
                It is strange that you answered so well the first
                and the second question, but with the third and the
                forth, where critical thinking is required, you get
                easily confused.
