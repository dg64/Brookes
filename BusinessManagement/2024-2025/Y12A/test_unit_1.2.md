## Rustam

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      4/4

Question 3      7/10
                The inheritance of shares depends from local legislations; 
                you can not count this as an advantage; the purchase / repurchase
                of the shares is not limited to PLC; if a shareholder of a LTD
                wants to leave and the others remaining agree, one can buy back
                the shares of the shareholder leaving or, in alternative, the
                remaining shareholders can split the shares and buy them back.

Question 3      2/4
                Also a LTD is bound to publish its accounting reports

Question 4      3/10
                This is absolutely insufficient for a question worth 10 points.
                You lost 7 points just because you omitted the structural
                elements of this answer.

## Aliciah

Question 1      2/2

Question 3      1/4
                You can not repeat the previous answer and you are expected
                to give two differences

Question 4      5/10
                You need to provide 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages.
                The loss of control for a PLC does not depend from the
                percentage of shares; it is a feature of this kind of
                legal organizational type. 
                Also, why do you thing that a PLC can not grow?

## Emily

Question 1      2/2

Question 3      4/4
                Be careful with the verbs. It is not that LTD do not allow
                to sell shares on the public; they are not allowed to do so.

Question 4      6/10
                The allocation of finance has nothing to do with the legal
                organizational type.
                You were expected to list the advantages and disadvantages (2
                each) for not being a PLC and staying a LTD.
