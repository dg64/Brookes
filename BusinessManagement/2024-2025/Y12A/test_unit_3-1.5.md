Question 6      1/6
                You reversed the order of the year, but still the analysis
                is incorrect. You can justify to increment in efficiency
                from Year 1 to Year 2 with an increment in revenue and profit,
                without any change in equity and liabilities, meaning no
                changes in the capital employed

Question 7      4/4

Question 8      1/4
                the difference in stock is the reason of the worsening of 
                the current ratio; for the acid ratio, the improvement
                in current assets is eaten up by the worsening of current
                liabilities.
