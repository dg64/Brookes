## Maria

Question 1      0/2
                Revise the definition of net cash flow

Question 2      7/10
                You can not start an analysis based on the
                PP, like you did. You need, at least the ARR to
                make an evaluation.
                You discarded the trend of the forecasted net
                cash flow too.
