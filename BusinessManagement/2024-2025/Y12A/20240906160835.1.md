Question 3      4/4

Question 4      4/10
                You made a couple of very wrong assumptions:
                - a recession is a moment of oppportunity
                - during recession the competition is far stronger than
                  during growth
                - prices are lower becose the purchase power is lower
                - you were not mean to talk about running businesses but
                  about startup businesses
