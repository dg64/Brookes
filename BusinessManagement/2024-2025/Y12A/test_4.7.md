Question 4      10/10
                These are the things that I liked in your answer:
                - you planned your answer
                - you addressed the customers' need satisfied by Mc Donald's
                - you mentioned that McDonalds' though global, is not present everywhere
                  Walmart and Starbucks are two other examples
                Kepp doing like that

                Insufficient and unacceptable.
                You need to write a mini essay for 10 points; you had
                enough time to answer the questions of the test and 
                you produced only 6 lines.

Question 4      8/10
                You lose two points due to a questionable statement and to
                a wrong statement; both of them in your conclusion.
                Questionable statement: "the fast food industrty is predominantly
                a galobalized industry due to the fast production of fodd and the
                availability to many target market in terms of costs" ...??? 
                What does it mean .. in terms of costs? ...
                Wrong statement: "Going global will always increase revenue"
                nothing is granted in business. Approaching new market only
                increases the chance for higher revenue
