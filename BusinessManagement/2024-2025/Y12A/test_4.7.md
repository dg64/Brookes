Question 4      10/10
                These are the things that I liked in your answer:
                - you planned your answer
                - you addressed the customers' need satisfied by Mc Donald's
                - you mentioned that McDonalds' though global, is not present everywhere
                  Walmart and Starbucks are two other examples
                Kepp doing like that
