Question 3      2/4
                With the all due respect with people that work in the 
                hospitality sector, I will not define their turnover
                a brain drain; this term is used to idenfity a phenonmenon
                in which high skilled people are leaving their home country
                to work as expats abroad due to better perspectives

Question 4      7/10
                There are two incorrect aspects in your answer:
                1 - nowhere is written the hotel industry in Ireland is financially
                    suffering. 
                2 - you mixed up induction with training

Question 4      7/10
                It is not enough to mention the company in the introduction and in the
                conclusion. What about the effect on customer service, customer loyalty,
                what about the level of service provided, the satisfaction rate of the
                customers?
                You completely forgot the company in your analysis.

                I understand that robots will take the place of humans
                beings in doing some works, but remember the personal
                touch needed when you deal with a business that requires
                a constant contact with the customers.

Question 4      7/10
                I conpletely disagree with the statement that training
                one employee does not make sense. It is a good way
                to start, trying with one the most promising employees
                to train in and ask him to train the others once his
                training has been completed.

Question 4      10/10
                Reading your handwriting is really difficult.
                I advised you to improve it, but I see no changes.
                This could be a problem for you, during the exam;
                the examiner needs to understand what he is reading
                in order to grade it.
                You've been warned.

## Ana

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      2/4
                You gave me only one element of the ratio

Question 3      4/4

Question 4      6/10
                The format of the answer is correct but your analysis
                is not. How do you value the service of an hotel:
                one of the parameters is how clean is the room when
                you check-in and how is kept clean during your staying.
                You do not see the cleaning personnel, but still you
                evaluate their work. How can you teach this part of
                the staff to clean efficiently in the least time
                possibile?
