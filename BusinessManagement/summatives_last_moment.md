Question 2      7/10 
                The tax is mean for buyers; it is not a corporate tax. The effect is that diesel cars
                will become more expensive and less attractive for customers. Car makers will see their
                sales of diesel car drop and they will have to work both on a short-term strategy and a
                long-term strategy, to counteract this tax; an example would be granting a year of paid 
                insurance for the purchase of a diesel car; in the long-term, the company can plan to
                discontinue the production of diesel engines.

                You made a thourough analysis but your answer is unbalanced.
                Never forget that you must provide two advantages and two disadvantages.
                The new law will have a negative impact on the short-term and long-term
                plans of carmakers; what are the possible positive outcomes?
                Can the company market is adherence to CSR standards? Can the company
                convert the production lines of diesel engines into prodution lines of 
                electric engines benefitting from economies of scope?
