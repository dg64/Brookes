                Too bad that I did not see any reference to motivational theories

Question 1      2/2
                This time I accept your answer, but you must revise the definition
                of TQM. ALL employees are involved; no one excluded.

Question 2      2/4
                What economies of scale? Lean Manufacturing goes in the opposite direction

Question 3      4/4

Question 4      7/10
                The goal for TQM is to make quality control not necessary.
                Quality does not increase because less material is used, but because a system
                of TQM and quality assurance is put in place.
                No reference to notivational theories

Question 1      2/2
                This time I accept your answer, but you must revise the definition
                of TQM. 

Question 2      4/4

Question 3      2/4
                Nowhere is written that Haisho has unsold stock

Question 4      7/10
                You analysis of TQM is not entirely correct; when all the staff is engaged
                in getting things right the first time, the efficiency of the company will
                improve drammatically; just this would allow the company to reduce the stock
                and with the cash saved, finance part of the new equipment.

Question 4      8/10
                Your analysis about de-motivation is incorrect. We are not talking about
                flow prouction. Too bad also that there are no references to motivational
                theories.
