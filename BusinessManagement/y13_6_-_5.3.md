Question 4      10/10
                Too bad that I did not see any reference to motivational theories
                or to change management strategies.

Question 1      2/2
                This time I accept your answer, but you must revise the definition
                of TQM. ALL emmployees are involved; no one excluded.

Question 2      2/4
                What economies of scale? Lean Manufacturing goes in the opposite direction

Question 3      4/4

Question 4      7/10
                The goal for TQM is to make quality control not necessary.
                Quality does not increase because less material is used, but because a system
                of TQM and quality assurance is put in place.
                No reference to notivational theories
