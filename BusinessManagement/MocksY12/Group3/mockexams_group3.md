Section A

Question 1 Sassy

		a		2/2


		b		3/6
				Here you made two mistakes: one is in the process and one is formal.
				You did not add the expected values of the two outcomes; for instance, for branch 1 
				you should have calculated (300.000 x 0.7) + (250.000 x 0.3) - 200.000 = 85.000
				The other error is not write the costs with a negative sign or within brackets

		a		2/2

		b		

			i	2/2

			ii	3/4

		c		1/2
				A decision tree assumes that what happened in the past will happen also in the future

Section B

		a		2/2

		b		2/2

		c		2/6
				Here the question clearly stated that the perspective was from the business side, not from
				the customer side, so I can not accept the benefit for the customer
				How the limited product range is going to affect negatively the company? You should have 
				mentioned the stronger competition in the e-commerce

		d		6/10
				You were expected to  mention 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages for each option
				You did not mention the different types of growth (orizontal and vertical forward); for each
				type of growth you did not mention advantages and disadvantages.
				With a merger there no more company A and company B; there is only company AB. Saying that a merger
				could potentially lead to lower sale for one of the no-longer existing companies makes no sense.

Ustinyia

Section A

		a		2/4
				it is correct to say that if you have a plan you know what is the next step, but you have to express
				this in business management terms; a strategy gives you direction, it motivates people, it will give
				you the framework for setting goals and targets ad corporate, divisional and departmental level

		b		0/2
				A joint venture is a combination of two businesses, that create a third legal identity, joining their

				Inflation is the rate of increase of costs, not the increase of costs itself

		b		0/4
				You need to read carefully the question and the test case; here you are required to give the perspective of the 
				business; for manufacturing industries the push-cost inflation has increased cost of production and eroded margin
				of profits; Chinese businesses might be forced to raise the price, with the possible effect of experiencing a decrease
				in sales

		c		1/4
				an increse in interest rate means that the cost of money is higher; as a consequence consumers will slow down in making
				hire purchases; this drop in demand will be reflect on the final price of products; business also will slow down
				meaning that their demand for raw material will decrease, causing a decrease in cost as well.

		d		0/10
				Here you were expected to write a mini essay, with an introduction, a body and a concusion.

                I will accept only one advantage and one disadvantage because
                for the others, even though they are correct, they use the
                perspective of the customers, while you were requested to
                describe advantages and disadvantages for the business.

        d       8/10
                It was good that you mentioned the two types of growth, but you
                made a mistake when you wrote than in option 2 TS could lose part
                of control of the marketing mix. How can you loose control if the
                company is yours?
