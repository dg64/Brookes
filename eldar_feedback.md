# Eldar feedback

The research question is not focused as it assumes a binary answer. The sources are appropriate but not relevant data are collected from them.
Most of the analysis based on the primary sources is purely qualitative and descriptive. There is evidence of partial understanding of the business tools selected.
The Fishbone diagram is inappropriate, because the root cause of the problem is already known: the sanctions. The STEEPLE analysis is presented after the SWOT analysis, while logically it should come first.
The Force Field analysis has no explanation about how the driving and restraining forces are calculated. 
Some financial tools are declared but not used.
The conclusion answers the research question but there is limited evidence of critical thinking. The structure is appropriate as it is the presentation.
