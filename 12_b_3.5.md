                The ratios for Year 1 are incorrect

                The calculation is incorrect but the analysis is coherent with the calculation

Question 5      2/2

Question 6      2/6
                The ROCE has decreased due to a higher amount of retained profit invested into the business.
                If the investment,as it seems, is meant to improve production efficiency, the ROCE can show
                an increase in the future reports

Question 7      4/4

Question 8      0/4
                You mixed up the years. Year 2 is the closest year to the actual time.
                Slight decrease in current ratio and acid ratio
                despite an increased availability of cash, there and an increase in Debtors
                there is an increase in cash tied in stock and this caused the worsening of the ratios
