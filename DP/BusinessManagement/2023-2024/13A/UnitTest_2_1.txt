Question 1	2/2

Question 2	0/2
		Turn over is the ratio between the number of employees leaving a company and
		the total number of employees of that company in a year

Question 3	2/4
		the question is not about internal or external recruiting; it is about job
		retention; a working place that does not offer perspectives is seen by
		employees as a temporary solution, in which is not worth spending
		too much energies. For the hotelier this means, high turnover, high
		recruitment costs, low service level, low customer satisfaction

Question 4	3/10
		You did not mention the company, which means that your answer is a theoretical one.
		Moreover, your answer lacks a structural element as there is no conclusion.
