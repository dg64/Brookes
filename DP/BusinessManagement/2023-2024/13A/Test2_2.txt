Question 4	8/10
		When you say that the culture clash finishes, you are assuming
		that workers (people) give up their cultural value. Do you
		think this is realistic? Even more with a culture like the
		Japanese one? So old and rich of tradition?

Question 1	4/4

Question 2	1/4
		Here you lost a chance. Religion, in some specific cases, can
		create a conflictual situation; but you have to explain which one.

Question 3	4/8
		For 8 points you need to write more than just two phrases.
		Scores are not gifted

Question 4	5/10
		I am being generous with this grading, because the situation that you
		depict in your answer, has nothing to do wiht the case study. The new
		ideas brought by the new managers are not accepted; their very presence
		is resented because of their disrespect of Japanese traditions.
		A more flexible approach would have granted more support from the Japanese
		worker.

Question 1	2/4
		The culture clash that you bring as an example, does not fit the question.
		A relevant example is a western company that has muslism employees that
		as to have the time and place to pray during the day

Question 2	0/4
		With increasing globalization, peple of different cultures have to work together;
		people with different attitude towwards work. Even two companies of the same country,
		selling the same product, have two different coporate culture, and merging them
		would result in a clash.

Question 3	4/8
		you must write more than 4 bullet points for 8 points

Question 4	7/10
		The structure of your question is perfect.
		What you have to improve is your analysis, that must be deeper. You must elaborate more
		your ideas. Why the fear of being fired? Why the resentment?
