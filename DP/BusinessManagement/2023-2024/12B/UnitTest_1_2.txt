Question 1	1/2
		Partners are not shareholders

Question 2	2/4
		Theoretical answer

Question 3	0/4
		The question is about a partnership, not about a limited company.
		Where did you get the information about suing your partner?
		By the way, it is incorrect. Stick to the content of the syllabus.
		Your answer is theoretical

Question 4	1/10
		Stability is not related with a PLCs. Marketing has nothing to do with shares;
		companies do not sell shares as a core business.
		Money is not a business management term.
		In a flotation there is no "a chance to lose ownership". The status of a PLC is
		legal, there are no chances on that.
		Competitors will not have all the information about you. Again, where did you
		take this information?
		I suggest you to start paying attention during the lessons, instead of
		drawing.
