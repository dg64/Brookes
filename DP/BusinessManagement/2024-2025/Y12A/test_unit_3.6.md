Question 1      2/2

Question 2      2/2

Question 3      0/2
                Incorrect calculation

Question 4      4/6
                You asssumed that Y2 was farther in the past and Y1 was more recent
                using this perspective the Creditor days ratio that changes from
                172 to 100 is not an improvement, since it means that JKL needs to
                pay quicker its suppliers

Question 5      4/6
                Here you loose point for not suggesting a better way to handle the stock;
                a 1.4 turnover, can not be solved just with selling for cash; there is
                a clear problem of forecasting the demand. Without adopting JIT, JKL
                has plenty of room for improvement.

Question 3      2/2

Question 4      3/6
                JIT does not work well with a retail business, and between a 1.4 rotation times
                and JIT there is a lot of range for improvement.
                The debtor ratio and the creditor reatios are both improved, showing that there
                is nothing more to do for JKL on this front.

Question 5      2/6
                You repeated the content of the previous answer. Why didn't you try to calculate
                the gearing ratio? Just looking at the reports you could see that there was no
                change in long term liabilities and that there was an increase in equity, meaning
                a lower gearing ratio.

## Farah

Question 1      2/2
                You were required to calculate the number of rations, not the number of days.

Question 2      2/2

Question 3      2/2

Question 4      0/6
                There is no relationship between your comment and the ratios calculated

Question 5      0/6
                Despite the fact that you considered Year 1 as more recent, while I stated
                the contrary during the test, you still gives a comment that is detached
                from the numbers. According to your perspective, customers pay slower by 
                nearly two months and suppliers are paid quicker by two months

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      2/2

Question 3      0/2
                No answer

Question 4      2/6
                You did not talk about debtors, but instead you talk about creditors
                without having calculated the creditor days

Question 5      3/6
                Saying that JKL sell less or more, related to the stock turnover does
                no make any sense
                The analysis of debtor and creditor days is affected by your incorrect
                calculation.
                Gearing ratio is not considered

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      2/2

Question 3      2/2

Question 4      4/6
                Please bear in mind that JIT is not suitable for retail businesses
                JKL has no raw materials, only jeans that buys and resells

Question 5      4/6
                You discarded the gearing ratio and you stated that JKL produces good
                which is not.

Question 3      2/2

Question 4      1/6
                You are not commenting any ratio calculated

Question 5      2/6
                You are expected to write more for 6 points and it is not true
                tat all the ratio are increasing; also, an increase or a decrease in a 
                ratio does not necessarily mans that is a good sign. Look at
                the debtor days: it decreased and this is a good sign as JKL is paid 
                quicker. The creditor days has increased and it is a good sign
                because JKL pays slower its suppliers.
