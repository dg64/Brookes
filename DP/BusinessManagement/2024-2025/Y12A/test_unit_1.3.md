Question 3      2/4
                SMART objectives are useless if they are not based on

Question 4      8/10
                Very thorough analysis. Too bad you did not mention
                that the second objective was not specific.
                You're on the right track.

                There is no conclusion in your essay and you never
                mention in your analysis that some objectives
                aren't SMART at all because they are either nor
                specific nor time constraint
