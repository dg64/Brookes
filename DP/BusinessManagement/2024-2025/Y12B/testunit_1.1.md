Question 3      4/4

Question 4      8/10
                You missed one point: start-up business.
                When you starts up, you have very tight finances and
                you can not afford to hire people, even if they are
                relatively cheap. On the other hand, during recession
                you can benefit from lower prices for rent and
                raw materials.

Question 1      0/2
                Services are in the tertiary sector

Question 2      0/4
                You missed the point; you were required to apply the 4 factors of production
                to the specific content:
                Land: your room
                Capital: your computer
                Labour: you
                Enterprise: you

Quesiton 3      2/4
                I can not accept the second reason. When you start up you can not afford to
                hire other people.
                - Low capital to start up
                - Capitalize from you experience or your hobby

Question 4      3/10
                There is no conclusion in your answer
                You missed the point of the question. You were supposed to talk avout advantages
                and disadvantages of starting up a business during recession
                - Advantages: lower costs for starting up; consumer looking for cheaper products / services
                - Disadvantages: increased competition, difficult to raise fund
