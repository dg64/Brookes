Question 4      5/10
                You started so well ...
                The answer is unbalanced since you did not say what the company
                gave up not becoming a PLC; also, there is no conclusion.
                This answer should be rated 3. Be more careful

Question 3      4/4

                When you mention the obligation of using consultants, you need to explain why;
                the same thing is when you state that the company is preventing itself for
                raising capital for its growth

Question 4      6/10
                Both a LTD and a PLC have legal separation and limited responsibility.
                You can not say that in PLC the board of directors can fire the owner
                because this is not technically true; it is actually the shareholders 
                that can vote against a director; if this director happens to be
                (like often is), a major shareholders, he has to step down.

Question 1      1/2
                A LTD is not necessary owned by a family and stakeholders are
                most of the time private

Question 2      3/4
                A retail cooperative does not make a product; it buys a product

Question 3      3/4
                The divorce of ownership from control does not relate with the
                manufacturing but with the decision making power

Question 4      6/10
                You need to revise the definition of LTD and PLC.
                Also a LTD can be subject to take over and staying as a LTD
                does not prevent the company to growh.
