Question 1      1/2
                Time constraint

Question 2      4/4

Question 3      4/4
                You can set a SMART objective but this does not mean
                that the objective is based on up to date data

Question 4      5/10
                Why didn't you analyze the other objectives?

## Matthew

Question 1      1/2
                Achievable
                Time constratint

Question 2      2/4
                If I assume that we are in 2022, the first objective is tactic
                The fifth objective is strategic

Question 3      2/4
                Goals needs to be based on up to date plans

Question 4      6/10
                I like that you analyzed all the objectives but your analysis is
                partially correct. For instance: the 3rd goal "to launch new products
                in the detergent market" is not specific, it does not say which product
                should be launched; it is not measurable, it is not time constrainted,
                it is impossible to say if it is relastic or achievable. 
                Usually, if you see that an obective doesn't match one criteria, do not
                not go further. It is not SMART already.

## Viktor

Question 1      1/2
                Time constraint

Question 2      2/4
                The definition of strategy and tactic is correct but not the association
                with the objectives of the case study

Question 3      2/4
                The objective may be SMART but also based on obselete information

Question 4      6/10
                I like that you analyzed all the objectives but your analysis is
                partially correct. For instance: the 3rd goal "to launch new products
                in the detergent market" is not specific, it does not say which product
                should be launched; it is not measurable, it is not time constrainted,
                it is impossible to say if it is relastic or achievable. 
                Usually, if you see that an obective doesn't match one criteria, do not
                not go further. It is not SMART already.

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      2/4
                The definition of strategy and tactic is correct but not the association
                with the objectives of the case study

Question 3      2/4
                The objective may be SMART but also based on obselete information

Question 4      8/10
                Goals, strategic or tactics, need to be SMART; this is a mandatory requirement.
                Even one characteristic not met is enought to qualify the goal as not SMART and
                not suitable to setting a strategy or a tactic about it.

Question 4      3/10
                You need to seriously revise limited companies.
                You haven't clear yet what is a owner and what is
                a shareholder; what a shareholder can and can't do
                in a LTD and what a shareholder can and can't do
                in a PLC
