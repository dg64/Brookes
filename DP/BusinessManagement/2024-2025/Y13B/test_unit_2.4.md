Question 3      2/4
                You did not consider the motivator factors related to the appraisal system and to feedback

Question 4      8/10
                Good that you referenced Herzeberg, but again you did not consider the motivator factors;
                The targets are given namely because it is difficult to assess the output of an
                employee/consultant.

Question 3      3/4
                Your application of Herbzeber theory is partially incorrect; the feedback
                and the performance related pay will work as motivators, while the cut of
                salary is a decrease of hygiene factors which will bring dissatisfaction

Question 3      4/4
                I will award the you the full score, but I fail to see
                the observation and measurament process

Question 4      7/10
                You did not mention any motivational theory.
                You say that PRP encourages job enlargment but You do not
                explain why and I fail to see the connection; the same is
                for job empowerment. You also reduce everything to "money"
                while the majority of the theories that we have seen
                says the opposite
