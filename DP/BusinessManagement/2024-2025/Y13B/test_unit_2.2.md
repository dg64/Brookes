                You overdid.
                Stating that companies need to use their revenue to pay redundancies 
                was a step beyound what you actually know about business management.
                According to the accrual princip of accounting, the cash for redundancy
                is accrued in the balance sheet and figures as a liability. 
                This aspect is out of the boundadies of the Curriculum e should not have
                been included in your asnwers. Stick to what wwas taught to you.

Question 3      2/4
                old-fashion communication was much more reliable. Before electronic communication
                was very difficult, and dangerous, to not respect the chain of communication. Now, with
                the email, it easy to address o put in copy people that are at different level of the
                hierarchy

Question 3      4/4

Question 4      8/10
                Mentioning the fact that delayering can be used only once as a cutting cost measure
                at that this is a drawback isn't really fair. If the goal it is only cutting cost,
                then you can point out that it is not a strategy that can be repeated.
                Drawbacks of delayering means that managers can not only have direct access to 
                shop-floor employees, they need to manage them, instruct them, motivate them.
                Top managers are not used to do that. This makes the initial statement questionable.

## Igor

Question 1      0/2
                Delayering does not mean making a structure smaller, but flatter cutting
                cost is not the only objectives and for sure is not the main one

Question 2      2/4
                Again the same mistake about cutting cost. 
                Maybe, next time, instead of chatting, you'd better pay attention.

Question 3      1/4
                Where teleworking is mentioned in your answer?

Question 4      6/10
                Firing is not a business management term and in any case is not appropriate in 
                this context. Delayering leads to a redundancy, not to a dismissal.
                Flat structure equal efficient company is not a verified equation.

                Theoretical answer

Question 3      0/4
                You need to do more than just rephrase the text of the case study
                What is the relationship between shop-floor employees and tele-working
                method

Question 4      7/10
                Wages are paid to workers. Employees and managers receive salaries
                The overloading is not related to work but to the amount of 
                electronic communication that can be generated.
