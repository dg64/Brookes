## Aleksandr

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      2/4
                Removing a layer from the hierarchy makes the
                organization more agile


Question 3      4/4

Question 4      5/10
                This analysis is weak.
                There many arguments that you did not explore
                Big companies relies on tall hierarchical structure to
                better manage the staff, while delayering on one hand
                causes a decrease in costs but also an increase in the
                stress and workload of managers that now have an increased
                span of command; meaning that they have to manage, control,
                "feed" more people that before.
                Staff is also affected because not everyone is comfortable in
                dealing with top managers and middle managers were a sort of
                shield for them

## Rufina

Question 1      0/2
                What you described is a dismissal

Question 2      0/4
                If you remove top-down and bottom-up communication
                how communication is supposed to travel?
                Removing a level from the hiearchy does not change
                the hourly cost of the staff, it decreases the 
                the overall amount of fixed costs

Question 3      2/4
                Why woud middle manager become less effective because
                of digital communication?
                I do not understand your last statement about the
                technology helping more teleworkers than some
                employees

Question 4      5/10
                Your ideas about delayering, delegation and effectiveness
                are a bit confused. You need to revise carefully all these
                topics

Question 3      4/10
                The reason for this score and the previous one is that
                it was impossible to understand your handwriting.
                You should receive a 0 for submitting a work like this.
                Do you think that an examiner will get crazy to try
                to understand your hadwriting?
