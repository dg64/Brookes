ALUGISHVILI ANA
********************************************************************************
Ana closes the first term with current attainment of 5 and her attendance is attested to 100%. Ana is a  well-mannered student and an active member of the class discussion. Anna shows a good understanding of business management concepts and theories, although sometimes the answer given isn’t entirely correct. In her summative assessments, there is consistent evidence of critical thinking, her answers are well-structured and clear to read. Ana has the potential to aim for a higher grade, and she actually reached out to me, asking how she can improve. In the new term, we will start some additional lessons aimed to address her weak points.
Recommendation: refine the skill for writing mini-essay answers, providing examples and connecting the test case with business management tools and theories.

AMRAKHOV DANIEL
********************************************************************************
Daniel closes the first term with current attainment of 3 and his attendance is attested to 100.%. Daniel has made moderated progress since the beginning of the year; he is well-mannered and silent; too silent during class debates. Daniel answers questions only if he is asked to; unfortunately, sometimes the answer is an “I do not know”.
In his summative assessments, Daniel show limited knowledge of the subject; some ability to structure answers but with insufficient clarity and often one-sided only. .
Recommendation: Daniel needs to revise carefully the requirements for answering business management and needs to be more proactive when the class debates about a test case

CHEKMAREVA ARINA
********************************************************************************
Arina closes the first term with current attainment of 3 and his attendance is attested to 96.91%. Arina has made moderated progress since the beginning of the year; during the lessons she is often distracted and, at times, she does not carry out the task given; her low grade is also due to the fact that she missed a summative assessment and she never reached to me asking to recover it.
In her summative assessments, Arina show limited knowledge of the subject; some ability to structure answers but with insufficient clarity and often one-sided only. I am personally convinced that she can do much more than that, but it looks like she does not want to.
Recommendation: Arina needs to change her attitude during the lessons and toward the subject in general. She needs to revise carefully the requirements for answering business management questions and the feedback given for her previous summative assessments.

DAMRONGMANEE PARISA
********************************************************************************
Parisa closes the first term with current attainment of 4 and his attendance is attested to 100%. Parisa pays the price of her initial doubts about choosing Business Management or Economics; she started with Business Management, then she switched to Economics, and only then came back to her original choice. Parisa has made good progress since the beginning of the year, considering that she had some gaps to recover from; during the lessons, she is focused and well-mannered.
Her summative assessments show a general knowledge and understanding of the topics covered;  her answers, are clear and balanced, but they are theoretical.
Recommendation: Parisa needs to work on her analytical skills; she needs to learn how to link a specific test case with business management content and tools.

His summative assessments show a general knowledge and understanding of the topics covered, but there are also gaps and misunderstandings. Andzhei still needs to familiarize himself with the requirements for answering business management questions, as he often forgets to write the introduction or the conclusion.
Recommendation: Andzhei has the right attitude and the potential to aim for a higher grade, but he needs to revise the structural elements required for an answer; he also needs to work on his analytical skills and learn how to link a test case with contents, tools and theories.

LEE SEOYUN
********************************************************************************
Seyoun closes the first term with current attainment of 6 and her attendance is attested to 98.31%. Since the beginning, Seyoun has shown great interest in the subject and her results were always attested around 6 or 7. She immediately understood the requirements for answering a question in Business Management; Seyoun's answers are well structured and clear to read; she provides examples from different perspectives and her own judgment in the conclusion. My only complaint about Seyoun is that she is always silent, and she answers only when prompted.
Recommendation: I would encourage Seyoun to be more active during class debates, as these debates are a kind of formative appraisal and are an integral part of the lesson in which everyone must take part.

LEONOVA DARIA
********************************************************************************
Daria closes the first term with current attainment of 4 and his attendance is attested to 93.32%. Daria has made moderated progress since the beginning of the year; during the lessons she is often distracted and, at times, she does not carry out the task given because she immediately gives up.
In her summative assessments, Daria shows some knowledge of the subject; some ability to structure answers but with insufficient clarity and often one-sided only; her command of business management terms is limited and seldom used in her answers.
Recommendation: Daria needs to change her attitude during the lessons and she needs to work with more commitment on the task assigned; She needs to revise the requirements for giving well-structured answers in Business Management.


********************************************************************************
NEKHVIADOVITCH ARTEMIJ
********************************************************************************
Artemij closes the first term with current attainment of 5 and his attendance is attested to 100%. Artemij has shown some progress since the beginning of the year; he is clearly interested in the subject, but his focus is not constant; he shifts from moments in which he is completely focused and present, to other moments in which is completely absent.
This behaviour is reflected in his summative assessments, in which Artemij shows a general understanding of the topics covered, but his knowledge has some gaps; there is evidence of analysis and evaluation skills,  but his analysis is always unbalanced. Artemij has the potential to reach higher grades and I look forward to it, but he needs to be more focused.
Recommendation: revise the comments given in the previous summative assessments and revise the requirements for giving balanced analyses and evaluations.

NGUYEN CHAU
********************************************************************************
Chau closes the first term with current attainment of 4 and his attendance is attested to 93.81%. Chau has made moderated progress since the beginning of the year; during the lessons, he is focused and well-mannered, but does not participate in the class debates, he answers only when and if he is prompted to. His summative assessments show a general knowledge and understanding of the topics covered, but there are also gaps and misunderstandings. More than once Chau mixed up topics and meanings of different business management tools.
Recommendation: Chau needs to change his attitude during the lesson; he needs to be more proactive and speak out when and if something is not clear to him. Class debates are a form of formative assessment that allow me to understand if a student is having issues with a particular topic. For this reason, it is important the active participation of the students.

In her summative assessments, Yelizaveta show limited knowledge of the subject; some ability to structure answers but with insufficient clarity and often one-sided only. I am personally convinced that she can do much more than that and, actually, she reached out to me, looking for advice on how to improve.
Recommendation: Yelizaveta needs to revise carefully the requirements for answering business management questions and the feedback given for her previous summative assessments.

********************************************************************************
Piya closes the first term with current attainment of 4 and his attendance is attested to 98.31%. Piya started the first term very well, but then her performance started to deteriorate;  during the lessons she is often distracted and, at times, she does not carry out the task given unless she is explicitly asked to.
In her summative assessments, Piya has shown some ability for analysis and evaluation; her answers are structured and clear, but often theoretical; there is no application of tools and theories to the test case analyzed.
Recommendation: Piya needs to be more focused during the lessons; she needs also to improve her time management skills, as she once came completely unprepared for a summative assessment because she did not check MaanageBac.
