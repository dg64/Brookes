BERKOVSKAYA VALERIA
********************************************************************************
Valeriia closes this term with current attainment of 4. Her mock exam scored a 7 with 53 out of 70 points. For what concerns the summative assessment, Valeriia started very well, but then her grades dropped to a concerning level; her answers did not show an understanding of the topics, and the analysis was contradictory or cryptic. If I didn’t know Valeria better, I would have said that she had problems with the subject, while in reality, the problem with Valeria is that she rushes to answer without thinking. She knows that and she was warned about that times and again. Fortunately, for the mock, she managed to control her usual rush and provided answers that reflect her real level of performance. Given these premises, my following statement and my recommendation will be based on the result of the mock, as I consider the previous summative assessments, an temporary and not representative setback.
Valeriia’s attendance is attested to 88.46%.
Recommendation: Valeriia needs to work on her analysis skills, to provide a more balanced answer, and to be able to link real test cases to business management strategies and/or theories.

IVANOV SERGEY
********************************************************************************
Sergey closes this term with a definite improvement from the previous year. His current attainment is 6 and in his Mock exam, he got a 7, with 33 out of 50 points. The progress is evident in the quality of his answers; now these are well structured, and balanced, with a clear explanation. There is evidence of a full understanding of business management tools and theories, even though these are not always connected to the test case analyzed.
Avoiding these silly errors could have granted him a more sound 7 for his mock exam, in place of a stretched one; the fact that since the last month, Sergey is on provisional learning, poses an additional challenge for him.
Sergey’s attendance is attested to 78.85%.
Recommendation: Revise the feedback given for the summative assessment and this mock and correct the mistakes highlighted.

LAWSON EMILIA
********************************************************************************
Emilia closes this term with current attainment of 6. In the mock exam, Emilia scored a 6 with 44 out of 70 points. The results of Emilia’s summative assessments show an upward trend, starting from a 4 and ending with a 7; given the fact that the criteria used to grade the summative assessments are more strict than the ones used to grade the mock exam, this proves that Emilia worked hard to improve her performance. Her answers are now structurally correct and the analysis shows knowledge and understanding of business management contents and tools. The mock exam has shown strengths and weaknesses of Emilia: her answer to the Paper 2 / Section C question is sound and well presented in structure and analysis; on the other hand, some wrong answers show that there are gaps in the recollection of some topics; I say recollection because I am sure that Emilia just needs to revise those topics to remember them.
Emilia’s attendance is attested to 100%.
Recommendation: revise the topics for which no points or fewer points were granted in the mock exam.


********************************************************************************
NIXON MARQUEZ-MARES ARIELA
********************************************************************************
Ariela shows a definite improvement from the previous year. Both her summative assessments of this term and the result of the mock exam are positioned at the maximum score. Ariela has improved in her writing style; her answers are clear and well structured; the analysis is always balanced and supported by appropriate business management terms.
The same neat structure and clarity are present also in her answer to the Paper 2 / Section C questions; in these answers, Ariela shows the ability to connect the test case selected, with the content of the syllabus, even though sometimes she misses something.
Ariela’s attendance is attested to 98.08%
Recommendation: Be more careful with figures, as in the Mock she committed an error of just copying a number; refining her skills in the answer to the Paper 2 / Section C question.


********************************************************************************
OREKHOVA DASHA
********************************************************************************
Dasha opened this academic year in the same way she closed the previous one.
So far she has the highest grade as her current attainment score and her Mock Exam scored a full 7 as well. Her answers are clear and well structured; the use of business management terminology is appropriate to the contexts and examples are always provided. Dasha proves her ability for critical thinking and evaluation both in the analysis and in the conclusions provided with her judgement.
Dasha’s attendance is attested to 98.08%.
Recommendation: Dasha needs to refine her skills in the answer for Section C of the mock exam; especially the connection between a test case and the content of the syllabus.


********************************************************************************
RASHID AYESHA
********************************************************************************
Ayesha made limited progress since the beginning of the year. Her current attainment for this term is 2, while the mock exam is graded 3.
Aysha’s attendance is attested to 90.38%
In her works Ayesha shows a limited knowledge and understanding of the subject; some sense of structure in the answers; a limited use of terminology appropriate to the subject; a limited ability to establish links between facts or ideas; Ayesha also missed some summative assessments and, despite repeated written warnings, she never shows a proactive attitude toward the subject. Her current average, related to the fact that she is an HL student, raises some serious concerns. 
Recommendation: Ayesha needs to change her attitude and work hard to reach the minimum level that would allow her to receive the diploma. 


********************************************************************************
REDKINA POLINA
********************************************************************************
Polina continues her trend of being an outstanding student. Both during the class debates and in the summative assessments, Polina shows a full command of the subject as well as the technical terms. Her answer are formulated clearly and directly; she provides examples to support her analysis and her judgement is always balanced. In the mock exam Polina got the full score, with 63 points out of 70; this result, normally very good for any student, in the case of Polina denotes a light decrease in her performance. This is a signal that Polina she should not underestimate. Overall her current attainment is a solid 7.
Polina’s attendance is attested to 100%.
Recommendation: Read carefully the feedback about the mock exam and reflect on what prevented her to reach the full score, like she always does. 


********************************************************************************
STENINA SOFIA
********************************************************************************
Sofiya closes the first term of this academic year with an additional improvement, since the end of the previous year. Her current attainment is now stable at 7, as it is her score for the Mock exam. It needs to be mentioned also that, even with grade boundaries a bit inflated, her score is a full 7.
Sofiya’s attendance is attested to 92.15%.
In this term I have also noticed in Sofiya an increased participation in class debates; this denotes more self-confidence; a quality that she lacked, despite her excellent results.
Her analytical and evaluation skills are sound as is her understanding of the subject.
Recommendation: as an SL student, she is about to finish the syllabus soon; but she can not afford to relax. Sofia needs to keep training in answering business management questions to maintain this level of performance.




********************************************************************************
SIWOO YANG
********************************************************************************
Siwoo joined the class only this year, but since the beginning of the term, he has distinguished himself for his behaviour and his performance. Siwoo is a well-mannered, but sometimes, too silent student. Given his scores and skills, I would appreciate it if he had more active participation in the class debates. His answers show a clear understanding of the topics studied; his analysis is balanced and well explained; the business management terms are always used appropriately. In the CUEGIS answer, he often references the same company, and he does it correctly; this shows his ability to look at a problem from different perspectives and to focus his analysis accordingly on the perspective selected.
The result of his mock exam confirms his excellent results: 7 for both the mock and the current attainment. Siwoo’s attendance is attested to 100%.
Recommendation: be more active during the class debates and let his peers benefit from his skills.


********************************************************************************
ELIZAVETA LEYB
********************************************************************************
Elizaveta closes the first term with current attainment of 5 and a score of 6 for the Mock exam, with 41 out of 70 points. Elizaveta’s attendance is attested to 100%.
Even though her beginning was not an easy one, she did not give up and she reached out to me to understand how to improve her score. Her work and her determination are testified by a 7 and a 6 received in the summative assessments that preceded the mock exam. The criteria for grading the mock exams are more relaxed, compared to the criteria used to grade the summative assessment; this is a signal for Elizaveta to read carefully the feedback about the mock and fix the small mistakes (some answers were purely theoretical and not contextualized ) that allow her to aim to a more solid result.
Recommendation: continue with an attitude of improvement and refinement.












********************************************************************************
ARINA SHALGINA
********************************************************************************
Arina closes this term with a full 7, with 46 out of 50 points. This result brings her current attainment up to 5. Given the nearly full score, it is clear that Arina has prepared herself for the mock exam. In her previous summative assessments, her analysis lacked dept and her answer did not go beyond the assertions without the provision of data or theories to support them. For the mock exam, it is clear that Arina made good use of the feedback received and corrected her mistakes. Such a great improvement can be also explained by the fact that very likely, she did not know the exact requirements for answering.
Arina’s attendance is attested to 98.08%.
Recommendation: Arina still needs to work on the Paper 2 / Section C answer, as she needs to learn how to connect a real test case with the content of the syllabus.




********************************************************************************
KSENIA LOBANOVA
********************************************************************************
Ksenia closes this term with current attainment of 6; her mock exam scored a 7 with 40 out of 70 points. Ksenia joined Brookes this year, and her beginnings with Business Management were not as satisfactory for me and her as well. Fortunately, Ksenia approached this setback with the determination to improve; she reached out to me to know how to obtain a better result and she made good use of my suggestions. Her scores in the summative assessment show a progressive improvement, in which the structure of the answers is the expected one in Business Management, and the level of analysis is deeper and more substantiated than in the beginning. 
Ksenia's attendance is attested to 100%.
Recommendation: Ksenia has still to work on the requirements of the Paper 2 / Section C question, as she forgets some structural elements; also the ability to connect the test case selected with the content of the syllabus is a skill that needs to be refined.




********************************************************************************
SELIN OZERDEM
********************************************************************************
Selin made limited progress since the beginning of the year. Her current attainment for this term is 3, while the mock exam is graded 4, with 27 out of 70 points. Selin’s attendance is attested to 96.15%.
In her works, Selin shows a limited knowledge and understanding of the subject; some sense of structure in the answers; a limited use of terminology appropriate to the subject; a limited ability to establish links between facts or ideas. The 4 of the mock exam is partially explained by the fact that the grade boundaries used to grade in the past were very inflated, but there is no guarantee that the same grade boundaries will be used for the May 2022 exam session. I see an improvement in the mocks, as Selin gave more articulated answers to questions that required a mini-essay or a definite structure in the writing. 
Recommendation: Selin needs to revise the minimum prerequisites for answering complex questions and the Paper 2 ./ Section C question. This will allow her to, at least, secure a 4. The next step would be to work on her analytical skills. 


********************************************************************************
ANDRIANI TOGAS
********************************************************************************
Andriani made limited progress since the beginning of the year. Her current attainment for this term is 2, while the mock exam is graded 3, with 23 out of 70 points.
Andriani’s attendance is attested to 92.31%.
In her works, Andriani shows a limited knowledge and understanding of the subject; some sense of structure in the answers; a limited use of terminology appropriate to the subject; a limited ability to establish links between facts or ideas. Despite these difficulties, Andriani is determined to improve and she is taking additional lessons in Business Management. This denotes a proactive attitude that I am sure, will soon reveal its fruits. 
Recommendation: Andriani needs to read carefully the feedback about the mock exam; take notes of the topics that she was not able to answer and establish a plan of action in which we can address all her gaps in the next private lessons.


********************************************************************************
YAN NEKLYUDOV
********************************************************************************
Yan closes this term with a definite improvement. Even though his current attainment is around 3; he started the academic year with a very concerning 1 during the first summative assessments; luckily he had a change of attitude and the next summative was graded 5. This progress demonstrates Yan’s ability to evaluate test cases and provide some sort of analysis, even though this analysis is more descriptive than numerical. There is also evidence of a moderate knowledge of business management terms.
Yan’s attendance in Business Management is attested to 98.08%.
It is clear to me that Yan has a lot of potential unexpressed and that, if he wants, he can aim for a higher grade; to do that he needs to work hard to fill all the gaps accumulated so far.
Recommendation: As a priority, Yan should concentrate on the prerequisites for answering IB questions: namely balanced analysis, reference of stimulus material, and own judgement supported by the analysis presented. As a next step, Yan should focus on the requirements for answering the Paper 2 / Section C question.

ALISA VAGER
********************************************************************************
Alisa made limited progress since the beginning of the year. The current attainment for this term is 3, while the mock exam is graded 4, with 18 out of 50 points. Her attendance in Business Management is 94.23%.
In her works, Alisa shows a limited knowledge and understanding of the subject; some sense of structure in the answers; a limited use of terminology appropriate to the subject; a limited ability to establish links between facts or ideas. What concerns me is the apparent lack of interest shown by Alisa; many silly mistakes present in her answers are due to just not complying with simple requirements. I must also point out that the criteria used to mark the mock exam are more inflated than the criteria that I used to mark the summative assessment; this should not give Alisa a false sense of security, since there is no guarantee that the same grade boundaries will be used in the next exam session. 
Recommendation: Alisa needs absolutely to read and understand the prerequisites for answering questions in Business Management. A document with criteria, requirements and suggestions has been provided via Managebac and it was discussed in more than one lesson; she needs just to take advantage of it.
