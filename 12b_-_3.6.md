Question 4      2/6
                What is the relationship between revenues and non-current
                liabilities? The non current liabilities haven't changed
                but the equity was, lowering the gearing ratio.

Question 5      0/6
                The gearing ratio is not an indicator of the efficiency of
                the company. You should have referenced the ROCE

Question 4      2/6
                The Creditor and Debtor days were already improved
                The Gearing ratio also has improved.
                What about the GPM?

Question 5      3/6
                Increasing the creditor days is beneficial for the company
                as it decreases the working capital cycle and thus, the
                amount of cash needed to run the business. The decrease
                of stock turnover suggests that JKL negotiateda longer
                credit terms in exhange for bigger orders. The gearing
                ratio has decreased due an increase in equity, while
                long-term liabilities di not change; this is a positive
                factor for the company. Unfortunately, this injection of
                cash is matched by a decrease in efficiency, show by ROCE

Question 4      2/6
                Creditor and debtor days were already improved from Y1.
                Increasing revenue is not a way to increase efficiency, we also
                know that sales manager improved their efficiency from Y1 to Y2
                Try have more sales for cash is a good advice
                You did not address the Inventory Turnover

Question 5      2/6
                The decrease of debtors days is positive sign, as it means that
                customers are paying quicker. The increase of creditor days is
                also a positive sign since it means that the company is slower in
                paying the suppliers. This is translate in a smaller working capital
                cycle, which means that JKL needs less cash to run the business.
                The stock turnover has worsened from Year 1 to Year 2; if you pair
                this ratio with the creditor days, we may assume that JKL negotiated
                longer payment terms in exchange for bigger orders.
                You did not consider the Gearing ratio and the ROCE
