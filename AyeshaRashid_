	In your analysis there is no mention of ARR and NPV; you were required to calculate the payback period
	to complete your analysis and there is no trace of it in your work. This tells me that the investment
	appraisal is an unknown topic to you. You were also required to write a paragraph related to
	two groups of stakeholders
