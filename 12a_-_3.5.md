                You need to explain why this happens.
                If you look at the Balance Sheet, you will see that from Year 1 and Year 2 there is an
                increase in equity; so more capital is invested into the business, but the investment is not
                yet matched by an increase in efficiency

Question 7      4/4

Question 8      1/2
