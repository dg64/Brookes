                It is the opposite. We have an increase in effciency in variable costs

Question 5      4/4

Question 6      4/6
                You need to explain why this happens.
                If you look at the Balance Sheet, you will see that from Year 1 and Year 2 there is an
                increase in equity; so more capital is invested into the business, but the investment is not
                yet matched by an increase in efficiency

Question 7      4/4

Question 8      1/2

Question 2      4/4

Question 3      2/4
                Good that you notice the percentage increase of Revenue and COGS, but why didn't you
                comment the NPM?

Question 4      0/4
                ROCE

Question 5      2/2
                You forgot the percentage sign; be careful; this costs points

Question 6      0/6

                being matched by an increase in efficiency

                You need to comment the variation from one year to another
                The comment that you wrote later is not correct; there is an improvement in GPM and a
                worsening of NPM

Question 1      1/2
                Where is the overhead?

Question 2      4/4

Question 3      2/4
                The analysis is incorrect; in these two sections we are dealing with variable costs (GPM),
                and fixed costs (NPM). GPM increases from Year 1 to Year 2, and if you notice, the percentage
                increase in Revenue is greater than the percentage increase in COGS, meaning that, either they
                had lower raw material costs, or they were more effcient in manufacturing.
                Unfortunately, the NPM has worsened due to an incraese of fixed costs.

Question 4      0/4
                ROCE

Question 5      2/2
                You forgot the percent sign. Careful, because it costs points.

Question 6      0/6
                Incorrect answer. He ROCE worsened because there is an increase in capital employed without
                being matched by an increase in efficiency
                
Question 7      4/4

Question 8      2/4
                Why NPM?
                There is a worsening of the current ratio, due to more cash tied into stock
