## Vladimir Ermolenko

Question 1      1/2
                Seasonal market has nothing to do with a niche market

Question 2      2/4
                Disadvantage incorrect

Question 3      2/8
                The calculation is incomplete and there are some steps missing
                You need to show all your work. I also find disturbing that
                you and Dzhamal made the same mistake.
                If this happens again, both your work and the one of your peer
                will be graded with a 0.

Question 4      0/6
