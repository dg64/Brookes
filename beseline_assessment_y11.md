Question 4      6/10
                The decrease in GDP IS the defining factor of recession.
                During recession there is an increase in competition.
                You can not state that during recession the demand falls;
                actually if falls for superior godds and increases for
                inferior goods.

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      3/4
                You did not specify the land

Question 3      2/4
                Do not quote the text; give your original answer.
                Starting a business in the tertiary sector during recession
                means that you can capitalize on your skills, reduce the
                startup capital and benefit from lower costs

Question 4      5/10
                Either you have some confused idea of recession, or you mispelled
                some words. During recession, very likely some people will lose their
                jobs, this is the opposite to having employment opportunities.
                Do not use the word "money" as it is not a Business Management term;
                in your case you could have stated that consumers have less
                disposable income.
                During recession the competition is stronger.

Question 3      2/4
