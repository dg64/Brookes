		are examples of qualitative factors

		Egyptian market, was to relocate its operation and create a joint venture, otherwise,
		due the political protectionism of the government, their cars would have been too
		expensive

		arabic supplier for the above mentioned politic of protecionism.

		a fraction of what would have been in Europe.
		Figures anmd stimulus material, must be used and referenced correctly.
