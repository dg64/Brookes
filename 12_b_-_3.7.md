                Increase sales FOR CASH. You missed thta important detail
                Changing location is a strategic decision and one that takes
                time to be implemented; Ducie has two months to react
                Cut marketing costs lead to a decrease in sales.
                When you propose a solution you must also point out risks and
                drawbacks

                Reducing the implicit cost is a very good proposal but you missed two
                details: the first one is that the additional time slots should be
                sold for cash; the second is that the costs of having more lessons
                does not surpass the benefits

Question 1      0/2
                Revise this chapter; the cash flow forecast has nothing to do with
                profitability; it is a tool used to verifiy if a company is going
                to face liquidity problem and, if that's the case, react in advance
                to avoid such situation

Question 2      4/4
                For this time I will grant you the full score, but bear in mind that
                you must give explanations. Of course if a company is experiencing
                liquidity problems you have cash outflows greater than cash inflows,
                but what are the causes? Too much credit to customers? Poor credit control,
                Unexpected expenditures, lack of planning?

Question 3      1/5
                You need to revise the entire chapter.
                In the Inflows section there is a row SR wich I do not what does it mean,
                and the worst thing is that I wrote the first numbers to the whiteboard
                The net cashflow also, has several errors: in April you have a total inflow
                of 21.000 and total outflow of 10.500 and as a net you reported 16.000 instead
                of (21.000 - 10.500) = 10.500, not to mention that the 21.000 is incorrect.
