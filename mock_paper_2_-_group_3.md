			Economy of scale does not depend solely from the output generated.

Question 3

		a	0/4
			SVT is organized by product, which means that each division is focused on the
			profitability of a specific line of products; for each division there is hierarchical
			structure dedicated, with a general director that can ensure that enogh resources are
			allocated to that division. As a drawback, this type of organization fosters conflicts
			and competitions between divisions and general directors

		b	5/6
			I award 5 points for this answer, but notice that you are meant to provide examples from
			the test case, that shows both internal and external growth

			SVT to see that sales are lower than forecasted and costs are higher that forecasted.
			The variance analysis allows SVT to monitor these deviations and take actions

		d	2/10
			You are required to make an analysis with benefits and drawbacks, referencing the
			stimulus material. Two for each option given. Just repeating what is in the text is not

Section C

	Criterion A 1
	Criterion B 1
	Criterion C 1
	Criterion D 3
	Criterion E 0

	Here you completely discarded the stimulus material involving ARR and NPV. The text instructed also to calculate
	the payback period to make the analysis. There is not trace of that in your text, which makes me assume that
	the topic of Investment Appraisal is unknown to you. You were also required to write a paragraph related to
	two groups of stakeholders.

	In your analysis there is no mention of ARR and NPV; you were required to calculate the payback period
	to complete your analysis and there is no trace of it in your work. This tells me that the investment
	appraisal is an unknown topic to you. You were also required to write a paragraph related to
	two groups of stakeholders
