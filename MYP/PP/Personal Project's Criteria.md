Personal Project's Criteria
========================

## MYP Personal Project Objectives

The objectives of MYP projects encompass the factual, conceptual, procedural and metacognitive dimensions of knowledge. Listed below are the objectives of the personal project specifically.

### Objective A: Planning
Students should be able to:

- state a learning goal for the project and explain how a personal interest led to that goal

- state an intended product and develop appropriate success criteria for the product

- present a clear, detailed plan for achieving the product and its associated success criteria.

### Objective B: Applying skills

Students should be able to:

- explain how the ATL skill(s) was/were applied to help - achieve their learning goal

- explain how the ATL skill(s) was/were applied to help achieve their product.

### Objective C: Reflecting

Students should be able to:

- explain the impact of the project on themselves or their learning

- evaluate the product based on the success criteria.

## Process

### Setting a goal

The personal project is truly personal because each student sets their own goal based on something that they find interesting. Students may draw inspiration from their prior experience in the MYP, such as:

- a global context that they find particularly compelling

- a service as action experience that they would like to build on

- a unit of inquiry that they would like to explore further.

Similarly, students may set a goal based on an interest or hobby that they pursue (or would like to pursue) outside school. Students should set an overall goal that can be achieved within 25 hours.

The overall goal for the personal project consists of two interrelated parts: a product and a learning goal. The product is what students will create and the learning goal is what they want to learn. While some students might begin the goal-setting process with a product in mind, other students will begin with a learning goal from which they will decide what kind of product to pursue. The learning goal that students begin with could lead to a variety of different products, just as a product could relate to a variety of learning goals (see figure 7 for an example).

Note that the product may be a tangible artifact such as a sculpture, film, story or model, or it could be a non-tangible result such as an awareness-raising campaign, learning to play a new piece of music or improving athletic performance. Students should be able to achieve the goal, including the learning goal and the product, and prepare the report in 25 hours. As such, students may need to revise their goal as they develop their action plan.

### Creating an action plan

Students will create an action plan for achieving their chosen product. This process is iterative: as students create their action plan, they will gain a sense of whether they can achieve the product within a reasonable time frame and they may revise their learning goal and/or product accordingly.

To create a detailed action plan, students should develop success criteria for their product and determine the necessary steps or actions that will be required to meet those criteria. This will also establish a foundation to explain whether or not the goal was achieved in the report.

The process of developing success criteria and establishing an action plan to meet the success criteria is likely to require some research. Similarly, students may need to carry out research related to their learning goal, which could be included as part of their action plan.

### Applying the ATL skills

Throughout the personal project, students should collect evidence of how they have applied the ATL skills.

This evidence may include:

- visual thinking diagrams

- bulleted lists

- charts

- short paragraphs

- notes

- timelines, action plans

- annotated illustrations

- annotated research

- pictures, photographs, sketches

- screenshots of a blog or website

- self- and peer-assessment feedback.

At the end of the personal project, students will select pieces of evidence to demonstrate the ATL skills that have had the most impact on their project. One piece of evidence must support their analysis of how ATL skill(s) were applied to extend their learning goal, and another must support their analysis of how ATL skill(s) were applied to achieve their product.

Students may find it helpful to evaluate their product before selecting the examples of the ATL skills to include in their report.

### Evaluating the product

When students have completed their product, they use the success criteria that were developed early in the personal project to evaluate the extent to which they achieved their product goal.

This evaluation forms the basis for explaining the impact of the project and can also help students to select the evidence of the ATL skills to include in their report.

Explaining the impact of the personal project
Because the personal project consists of a learning goal and a product, it can result in a variety of impacts on the student and/or the community (see table 8).

| Possible impacts of the learning goal | Possible impacts of the product |
| --- | --- |
| Develops specific ATL skills | Meets a need in the community|
| Extends knowledge about an area of interest | Showcases the students’ skills or abilities |
| Gains confidence by completing an independent project | |

 ## Reporting the MYP personal project

A report is a spoken or written account of something observed, heard, done or investigated. A report aims to inform as clearly and succinctly as possible. The MYP personal project report demonstrates a student’s engagement with their personal project by summarizing the experiences and skills recorded throughout the process.

The report should be presented in identifiable sections following the MYP personal project objectives—planning, applying skills, and reflecting, as shown in table 9. The report must include evidence for all the strands of all criteria.
    
 
 | Objective A: Planning | Objective B: Applying skills | Objective C: Reflecting |
 | --- | --- | --- |
| Students present **what** they did in their project. |  Students show **how** ATL skills contributed to the learning goal and product. | Students report on **why****** they did their project. |
| Students: <br> <ul><li>state a learning goal for the project and explain how a personal interest led to that goal</li><li>state an intended product and develop appropriate success criteria for the product</li><li>present a clear, detailed plan for achieving the product and its associated success criteria.</li></ul><br> | Students: <br> <ul><li>explain how the ATL skill(s) was/were applied to help achieve their learning goal</li><li>explain how the ATL skill(s) was/were applied to help achieve their product</li><li>support the explanations with detailed examples or evidence.</li></ul><br> |Students:<br> <ul><li>explain the impact of the project on themselves or their learning</li><li>evaluate the product based on the success criteria</li><li>support their comments with specific evidence or detailed examples.</li></ul><br> |
| Examples of supporting evidence could include:<br><ul><li>a list and/or diagram of interests and related learning goals</li><li>a list of possible strategies to achieve personal and academic goals</li><li>a diagram showing the connections between the learning goal and the product</li><li>a series of steps leading to the completion of the product</li><li>a timeline for completing short- and long-term tasks.</li></ul><br> |Examples of supporting evidence could include:<br><ul><li>a series of inquiry questions (research skills)</li><li>sample correspondence with the project supervisor (communication skills)</li><li>screenshot of daily reminders or alerts to complete personal project tasks (self-management)</li><li>reflection about resolving a conflict (social skills)</li><li>summary of prior learning that is relevant to the project (thinking skills).</li></ul><br> | Examples of supporting evidence could include: <br> <ul><li>evaluation of the product against the success criteria</li><li>images showing key features of the product</li><li>analysis of the causes for success and/or failure</li><li>summary of new knowledge or insights related to the learning goal.</li></ul><br> |

Please note that examples of supporting evidence are offered as suggestions and should not be understood as prescriptive or exhaustive. Students are encouraged to gather a variety of evidence throughout the development of their project so that they can select the evidence that best supports the claims that they make in the report.

The format of the report for the personal project can vary depending on the resources available and the interests of the students. Students should take into consideration learning preferences, personal strengths and available resources when deciding on the best format for the report. The ability to communicate clearly and concisely is essential to demonstrate the elements of the report and reach the highest levels of the criteria. The student’s supervisor is responsible for providing guidance on the format of the report.

Students may submit their report and evidence in any combination of documents and recordings that fits within the limits outlined in the table below. Table 10 shows the maximum length of students’ submissions.


| Document<br>File types: .doc, .docx, .pdf (non-editable), .rtf | | Recording<nr>File types: .mp3, .m4a, .mp4, .mov (codec H264), .m4v |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 15 pages | and | no recording |
| 14 pages | and | 1 minute |
| 13 pages | and | 2 minutes |
| 12 pages   | and | 3 minutes |
| 11 pages | and | 4 minutes |
| 10 pages | and | 5 minutes |
| 9 pages | and | 6 minutes |
| 8 pages | and |  7 minutes |
| 7 pages | and  | 6 minutes |
| 6 pages | and | 8 minutes |
| 5 pages | and | 9 minutes |

```
    Table 10 - The maximum length of student submissions
```

When preparing documents and recordings, the following specifications should be noted:

1. To ensure that the written part of the report is clearly legible, each page must have a minimum:

    - 11-point font size

    - 2 cm margins.

2. Where a spoken report is submitted, the only evidence that will be considered for assessment is the audio itself, plus any supporting pages of documents. Visual aids (such as PowerPoint slides) may be used to support a spoken presentation, but these will not be considered as a constituent part of the submission for assessment purposes.

3. Evidence presented in images must be clearly visible at the size submitted.

4. The bibliography is uploaded separately and is not included in the page limit.

5. Please do not include a title page; if included, it will count towards the page limit.

>Oral, visual and multimedia reports must be recorded for internal standardization purposes and for possible submission for moderation. Supervisors must ensure that the quality of the recording is sufficient for submission to the IB.

Students should be able to achieve the goal, including the learning goal and the product, and prepare the report in 25 hours. Planning, drafting, rehearsing and preparing materials are all necessary steps, and students should be aware of the amount of time required to complete the report. Students should be careful to ensure that their report is a distinct component of the MYP personal project and is not simply a collection of evidence.

If a personal project involves group work, each individual student must create their own report, clearly demonstrating their contribution in all stages of the personal project. Further, each student must collect their own evidence of the process.

When submitting the report for assessment, students must also include the completed academic integrity form. This is not included in the page limit.  

## Using assessment criteria

Assessment for the MYP personal project is criterion-related, based on three equally weighted assessment criteria (table 11).


| Criterion | Objective | Maximum weighting |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Criterion A | Planning | 8 |
| Criterion B | Applying skills | 8 |
| Criterion C | Reflecting | 8  |


```
    Table 11 The relationship between assessment criteria, objectives and marks
```

>MYP personal projects must assess all strands of all three assessment criteria.

In the MYP, objectives correspond to assessment criteria. Each criterion has eight possible achievement levels (1–8), divided into four bands that generally represent limited (1–2); adequate (3–4); substantial (5–6); and excellent (7–8) performance. Each strand within each band has its own unique descriptor that teachers use to make “best-fit” judgments about students’ progress and achievement.

This guide provides the required assessment criteria for the personal project developed in year 5 of the MYP. Schools must use the appropriate assessment criteria as published in this guide to report students’ final achievement in the programme.

The personal project coordinators and supervisors clarify the expectations for the MYP personal project with direct reference to the assessment criteria. Reference to the command terms and their definitions will help coordinators and supervisors to explain clearly what students are expected to know and do. This can be addressed in forms such as:

- a face-to-face or virtual discussion

- an information day

- detailed advice pages on the school intranet

- reference to assessed student samples of the personal project and/or other tasks.

## MYP personal project moderation

>The official validation of personal project grades is mandatory for all MYP schools ending in year 5, and requires a process of external moderation of the supervisor’s internal standardized assessment.


The term moderation refers to the checking and standardization of assessment. Adjustment of the results may or may not be required following the process, depending on the supervisors’ understanding and application of MYP personal project assessment criteria.

### Requirements for assessment

The personal project report is assessed against the personal project criteria published in this guide.

The personal project must be the student’s own work but the student’s supervisor should play an important role supporting the student through the minimum of three meeting sessions that will be reported on the academic honesty form. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that students are familiar with the requirements of the project and the assessment criteria at the strand level.

Supervisors should provide appropriate formative feedback that guides students in developing and improving their work. Supervisors are responsible for using principled professional judgment when determining the nature and extent of feedback they provide on students’ personal project reports. As a shared standard of good practice, supervisors must provide only one round of formal feedback on candidates’ project reports. It is appropriate to provide general guidance rather than extensive annotations, detailed edits or extended critiques.

To ensure fairness and to prevent undue influence, supervisors’ feedback on personal projects must only advise students generally on how to approach and complete their work. Once students have submitted the final versions of their project materials for school-based assessment, they cannot be retracted or redone.

Supervisors must ensure that all student work submitted for external assessment is prepared according to IB requirements. In particular, students and supervisors are responsible for understanding all IB academic integrity requirements, especially those relating to authenticity and intellectual property. Supervisors must explain clearly to students and parents that all work submitted for school-based assessment—including MYP personal projects—must be the candidate’s own authentic and individual work. Supervisors must use appropriate means to ensure that each candidate’s work is, in their professional judgment, authentic. If a candidate does submit work for assessment that is not authentic, the school must follow its internal policy for dealing with academic integrity issues.

Plagiarism and collusion are serious breaches of IB regulations, potentially subjecting candidates to consequences for academic misconduct. In addition, inauthentic student work can distort assessment results and potentially disadvantage all students in the school’s cohort by unfairly skewing its moderation sample.

When awarding criterion level totals, supervisors must base their judgment of student achievement entirely on the completed candidate work that is to be presented for moderation. Reported achievement levels should not be influenced by the supervisor’s previous experience with the candidate or by work that is not represented in the candidate’s materials submitted for the personal project.

If more than one supervisor is responsible for assessment, an internal standardization process should be used to ensure that all candidates are marked to the same standard. Supervisors are encouraged to keep a record of their comments about the candidate’s project to explain the levels they have awarded—especially where marginal judgments are made—as they help the examiner support the supervisor’s judgments. Supervisor comments should be uploaded with projects that are selected as part of the moderation sample.

Personal project subject-specific grade descriptors
Subject-specific grade descriptors serve as an important reference in the assessment process. They are the result of careful analysis of subject-group criteria and the general grade descriptors, and they have been written to capture and describe in a single descriptor the performance of students at each grade for MYP projects.

Subject-specific grade descriptors are also the main reference used to select grade boundaries for the personal project in each assessment session. During this process, the grade award team compares student performance against descriptors of achievement at grades 2 and 3; 3 and 4; and 6 and 7 (other boundaries are set at equal intervals between these key transitions). The grade award process sets boundaries for the personal project for each examination session, with reference to real student work.

Subject-specific grade descriptors tie eAssessment to criterion-related assessment and to MYP assessment criteria and level descriptors, which put the programme’s criterion-related assessment philosophy into practice. These are shown in table 12.

<br>


| Grade |  Descriptor |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | Produces work of a very limited quality. Conveys many misunderstandings of the process of learning independently. Very rarely demonstrates critical thinking. Very inflexible, rarely shows evidence of knowledge or skills.<br> |
| 2 | Produces a report of limited quality. Communicates limited understanding of the process of learning independently. Demonstrates limited evidence of critical thinking. Limited evidence of transfer of knowledge or approaches to learning skills into the project.<br> |
| 3 | Produces an acceptable report. Communicates basic understanding of the process of learning independently through the project. Begins to demonstrate some basic critical thinking. Begins to transfer knowledge and approaches to learning skills into the project.<br> |
| 4 | Produces a good-quality report. Communicates basic understanding of the process of learning independently through all stages of the cycle of inquiry. Often demonstrates critical thinking. Transfers some knowledge and some approaches to learning skills into the project. <br>|
| 5 | Produces a generally high-quality report that demonstrates a thorough process. Communicates good understanding of the process of learning independently through all stages of the cycle of inquiry. Demonstrates critical thinking, sometimes with sophistication. Usually transfers knowledge and approaches to learning skills into the project.<br> |
| 6 | Produces a high-quality report that demonstrates a thorough process. Communicates extensive understanding of the process of learning independently through all stages of the cycle of inquiry. Demonstrates critical thinking, frequently with sophistication. Transfers knowledge and approaches to learning skills into the project.<br> |
| 7 | Produces a high-quality report that demonstrates a thorough process. Communicates comprehensive, nuanced understanding of the process of learning independently through all stages of the cycle of inquiry. Consistently demonstrates sophisticated critical thinking. Successfully transfers knowledge and approaches to learning skills into the project with independence.<br> |
