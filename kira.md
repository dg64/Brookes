                Lean production may be implemented in several ways; JIT is one of them.
                Another one is TQM. The company is clearly facing financial difficulties
                and is unable to invest in capital equipment; TQM, on the other hand,
                starts with a change in mentality and attitude toward quality.
                That could have been thew first step towrds a full lean implementation

Question 5  5/10
            You answer is theoretical; you did not take into account the fact that the company
            has no financial resource to finance the introduction of JIT; as alternative,
            they can introduce TQM which is still a lean management approach and requires
            a much lower investment.
