# Macroeconomics objectives

## Economic growth

**Economic growth** refers to a sustained increase in a country’s real GDP over time. This is usually expressed as the annual percentage change in real national output.

**GDP** measures the monetary value of goods and services produced within a country for a given period of time, usually one year. Real GDP is the value of an economy’s national output that has been adjusted for inflation in order to reflect the true value of goods and services produced in a given year.

**Negative economic** growth occurs when the level of economic activity declines, that means, there is a fall in real GDP. This is associated with a recession in the business cycle.

**Actual output** refers to the current, rather than potential, level of real GDP in the economy.

**Actual growth** refersto short-term growth which occurs when an economy moves towards its potential level of GDP (as illustrated by the PPC) by using more of its resources in more efficient ways.

**Potential output** refers to the possible level of real GDP of an economy, as shown on
its production possibility curve, if all resources are used efficiently. It is a long run phenomenon represented by an outwards shift of the PPC.

**Nominal economic** growth (or nominal GDP) is the annual rate of change in the monetary value of GDP. Changes in nominal GDP figures are expressed at current prices.

**Real economic** growth (or real GDP) is the annual rate of change in the value of nominal GDP after it has accounted for changes in the price level, that is, inflation. Changes in real GDP figures are expressed at constant prices.

### Consequences of economic growth

+ Economic growth tends to lead to higher standards of living for most people in the country. Higher real income levels enable people to spend more money to meet their needs and wants. This helps to reduce or eliminate absolute poverty in the country.
+ By contrast, negative economic growth results in a recession followed by unemployment and a drop in standards of living.
+ Economic growth often involves using up the world’s scarce resources at rates that are not necessarily sustainable, such as deforestation and overfishing. This leads to market failures and negative externalities, causing climate change and problems to the natural environment and damage to ecosystems.

## Low unemployment

**Formal sector employment** refers to officially recorded  employment, with workers paying income taxes and contributing to the country’s official GDP

**Unemployment** refers to the situation when people are willing and able to work and actively seeking employment but are unable to find work.

The **unemployment rate** measures the percentage of the labour force that is unemployed. It is calculated by the formula: (Total unemployed ÷ Total labour force) x 100.

The **labour force** refers to people of working age who are in employment (including the self-employed) plus those who are seeking work, that is, those who are available for work at current real wage rates.

The **claimant count** is a measure of the number of people who are out of work, actively seeking employment but claiming unemployment benefits.

**Hidden unemployment** (or **disguised unemployment**) refers to those who are technically unemployed – as they do not have full-time j obs – but are not included in the official measurement of unemployment; for example, discouraged workers and underemployed workers

**Discouraged workers** are people who have stopped looking for jobs as they have become disheartened having tried but been rejected by prospective employers too many times

**Voluntarily unemployed** people are economically inactive individuals who choose not to pursue full-time employment.

**Underemployment** refers to the underutilization of the labour resources in the economy, which limits the economy’s productivity and efficiency.

The **female participation rate** measures the proportion of women who are economically active in the labour force

**Cyclical unemployment** (or **demand-deficient unemployment**) is unemployment caused by a lack of demand for goods and services in the economy.

A **deflationary gap** is the negative output gap in the economy, shown by the difference between the level of aggregate demand and that needed to achieve full employment.

**Structural unemployment** exists when the demand for labour is less than the supply of labour in a particular industry.

**Seasonal unemployment** is unemployment caused by regular and periodical changes in the derived demand for labour at different times of the year.

**Frictional unemployment** is a cause or type of unemployment that exists when people are temporarily unemployed while they actively search for a new job or are waiting to start a new j ob.

### Costs of unemployment

+ Personal costs
+ Stress  
+ Low self-esteem  
+ Poverty  
+ Family breakdowns  
+ Social costs
+ Crime and anti-social behaviour  
+ Indebtedness  
+ Social deprivation  
+ Economic costs
+ A loss of GDP  
+ Loss of tax revenues  
+ Increased cost of unemployment benefits  
+ Loss of income for individuals  
+ Greater disparities in the distribution of income and wealth  

## Low and stable rate of inflation

**Inflation** is the sustained rise in the general price level in an economy over time, that is, prices in the economy are, on average, rising over time.

**Price stability** occurs when the general level of prices remains largely constant due to a low and stable rate of inflation in the economy.

**Hyperinflation** (or **runaway inflation**) refers to extortionately high and uncontrollable rates of inflation that causes serious macroeconomic problems

The **consumer price index (CPI)** is a weighted index of average consumer prices of goods and services over time, used to measure inflation (or changes in the cost of living) for the average household in the economy.

**Money supply** is the amount of money in circulation within the economy at a particular point in time, as determined by the central bank. The money supply comprises legal tender (banknotes and coins), loans, credit, bank deposits and central bank reserves.

**Demand-pull inflation** is inflation caused by higher levels of aggregate demand (AD) in the economy, which drives up the general price level.

**Cost-push inflation** refers to inflation caused by higher costs of production, such as higher labour costs or skyrocketing rents. It is shown by a leftwards shift of the aggregate supply (AS) curve, thereby forcing up average prices.

A **wage-price spiral** is a circular cause of higher inflation due to trade unions negotiating higher wages owing to higher costs of living, which causes higher costs of firms.

**Menu costs** are a cost of inflation because with prices continually rising, firms incur ongoing costs of changing and updating price lists and price tags

**Shoe leather costs** are a cost of inflation, as customers spend more time searching for the best deals; that is, it represents a greater opportunity cost for customers in terms of
time and effort needed.

**Deflation** refers to the persistent fall in the average price level in an economy over time, that is, lower prices in general.

**Benign deflation** is generally unharmful deflation as the economy is able to produce more without an increase in the general price level (shown by an outwards shift of the SRAS curve).

**Malign deflation** is generally harmful deflation due to a decline in aggregate demand for goods and services in the economy (shown by an inwards shift of the AD curve, and, hence, a fall in real GDP)

**Disinflation** occurs when there is a fall in the rate of inflation, that is, prices are still rising, but at a slower pace.

A **deflationary spiral** is a circular process of downward pressure on the general price level caused by a weak economy, which leads to lower wages and confidence levels that in turn causes prices to fall further.

## Sustainable level of government

A **budget deficit** exists when the value of government spending exceeds government revenue per time period, that is, G > T.

**Government debt** (or **national debt**) refers to the sum of all accumulated government budget deficits from previous years, that is, it is the total amount of money owed by the government to its domestic and foreign creditors.

**The debt to GDP ratio** shows a country’s national debt as a percentage of its GDP (national income).

**Debt servicing costs** are the expenses of financing the national debt, that is, repaying the principal amount borrowed plus interest costs.

**Credit rating** refers to the measure of a borrower’s ability to repay a loan. A high credit rating means the borrower has a good credit history and a perceived low level of risk.

**Austerity measures** refer to cutbacks in fiscal spending in order to repay national debt. This is achieved by reducing government spending and raising taxation.

+ There is a direct relationship between budget deficits and government debt, that is, each budget defcit adds to the value of national debt.
+ The costs of high government debt include: debt servicing costs, low credit ratings, and negative impacts on future taxation and government spending policies.

## Potential conflicts between macroeconomic objectives

**Conflicting macroeconomic objectives** means that it is not always possible for a government to simultaneously achieve all of its macroeconomic objectives owing to
potential trade-offs.

### Potential conflict between the main macroeconomic objectives:

+ low unemployment and low inflation
+ high economic growth and low inflation
+ high economic growth and environmental sustainability
+ high economic growth and equity in income distribution.

The **short run Phillips curve (SRPC)** shows a potential trade- off between pursuing low unemployment and low inflation as macroeconomic obj ectives.

The **natural rate of unemployment (NRU)** is the level of unemployment at the full
employment equilibrium level of national output, comprising frictional, seasonal and structural unemployment.

**Stagflation** occurs when there is raising inflation but falling national output and rising unemployment

The **long run Phillips curve (LRPC)** shows that in the long run, there is only a single
rate of unemployment (the natural rate) that is consistent with a stable inflation rate. Hence, the LRPC is vertical, that is, there is no trade-off between low inflation and low unemployment.

The **short run Phillips curve (SRPC)** shows a trade-off between unemployment and inflation. Lower unemployment, caused by a rise in aggregate demand, creates more spending in the economy thereby causing higher inflation. (HL only)

+ The natural rate of unemployment (NRU) occurs the sum of frictional, structural and seasonal unemployment in the economy, irrespective of the general price level, that is, there is no trade- off between low unemployment and low inflation. (HL only)
+ An increase in aggregate demand will tend to cause a movement up (to the left) along the short run Phillips curve because unemployment falls while the general price level begins to rise. (HL only)
+ Any short-term attempts to reduce unemployment beyond its natural rate will be ineffective and unsustainable in the long run as the resulting ination leads to workers expecting and demanding higher nominal wages. (HL only)
+ The long run Phillips curve (LRPC) shows that in the long run, unemployment will revert to its natural rate that is consistent with a stable inflation rate so there is no trade-off between low inflation and low unemployment. (HL only)
