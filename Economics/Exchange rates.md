Exchange rates
========================

**Exchange rates** are the value of one currency expressed in terms of another currency.

A **floating exchange rate** is where the value of a currency is determined by the demand for and supply of the currency in the foreign exchange market

**Appreciation** is a sustained increase in the value of one currency in terms of another under a floating exchange rate system.

**Depreciation** is a sustained decrease in the value of one currency in terms of another under a floating exchange rate system.

The value of a currency is determined by changes in demand and supply in the currency market (or the foreign exchange market). These changes result in a change in the value of a currency through the price mechanism. This is the same way that the price and quantity of any other good or service is determined in a perfectly competitive market without government intervention. It is important to note here that any factor that generates demand for a currency will cause an increase in the supply of another currency. After all, the definition of exchange rates is the value of one currency in terms of another. Buyers of a currency must first exchange their own currency in order to buy the foreign currency. This feature of exchange rates has great importance for the balance of payments

**Inward foreign direct investment** refers to foreign multinational companies expanding their
operations in the domestic economy.

**Outward foreign direct investment** refers to multinational companies from the domestic economy expanding their operations in overseas markets.

**Portfolio investment** is the purchase of financial investments abroad, such as the purchase of stocks, shares and bonds of overseas firms and governments.

**Inward portfolio investment** represents spending in the domestic economy by foreign investors.

**Outward portfolio investment** represents spending by an economy’s investors in overseas markets.

**Remittances** refer to the movement of money when nationals working abroad send money back to their home country.

**Speculation** occurs when a financial asset, such as the domestic currency or a foreign currency, is purchased in the hope or anticipation that the resale value will be higher.

**Inflation** is the sustained (continual) increase in the general (average) price level, over time. It is commonly measured by using a consumer price index (CPI).

The **interest rate** is the price of money. Expressed as a percentage measure, interest rates represent the cost of borrowing money or the return for savers.

**Economic growth** is a key macroeconomic objective that measures the increase in the level of national output over a specified period of time. It can be measured by the annual percentage change in the economy’s real gross domestic product (GDP).

**Net exports**, the value of exports minus the value of imports, are part of the aggregate demand equation (and GDP).

### The inflation rate
Fluctuations in the value of an economy’s currency can lead to various forms of inflation, disinflation and even deflation in extreme circumstances. Changes in the exchange rate can impact both cost-push and demand-pull inflation. Demand-pull inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level due to an increase in the components of factors of production (increased consumption, investment, government spending and net export expenditure). Cost-push inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level due to an increase in the costs of production in an economy

## Economic growth
Economic growth is an increase in the value of real national income over time. An appreciation of the currency will lead to an increase in the price of exports and a decrease in the price of imports. The result of this may be a decrease in net exports, although this will depend on the value of price elasticity of demand for the country’s exports

## Unemployment
An appreciation of a currency may lead to a significant reduction in the demand for exports, as they are now more expensive in foreign economies. This reduction in export revenues may eventually result in firms reducing their demand for labour (due to derived demand). This will generate some unemployment in the economy.

## Living standards
The value of a country’s currency can have a significant impact on the standard of living in that economy. A strong currency will bring benefits to consumers of imported goods and services as they will need to exchange less of their own currency or money to purchase the imported items. In more economically developed economies, these imported items are more likely to be wants (desires) and luxury goods and services.


The **current account** is a record of all trade flows (exports and imports of goods and services), income flows and income transfers between countries by individuals, firms and governments

A **fixed exchange rate** system exists when the central bank (or monetary authority) buys and sells foreign currencies to ensure the value of its currency stays at a single, predetermined rate

**Foreign currency reserves** (or **reserve assets**) are stocks of foreign currencies held by a central bank, usually to influence the value of its currency.

**Devaluation** occurs when the price of a currency operating in a fixed exchange rate system is officially and deliberately lowered.

**Revaluation** occurs when the price of a currency operating in a fixed exchange rate system is officially and deliberately increased.

## How fixed exchange rates are maintained
As with a freely floating exchange rate system, the value of a currency in a fixed exchange rate regime is determined by the market forces of demand and supply.

A **managed exchange rate** is a system where the government or central monetary authority intervenes periodically in the foreign exchange market to influence the exchange rate, when deemed necessary to maintain certainty and confidence in the economy.

A **crawling peg** is a form of fixed exchange rate system in which a currency is permitted to fluctuate within predetermined bands of exchange rates.

An **overvalued currency** occurs when the value of a currency is above its equilibrium value in the long run.

An **undervalued currency** occurs when the value of a currency is below its equilibrium value in the long run.

## Fixed versus floating exchange rate systems

In general, fixed exchange rate systems bring greater benefits to firms than they do to governments. The disadvantages of fixed exchange rate systems can be seen as the advantages of a floating exchange rate system and vice versa. The arguments for and against fixed and floating exchange rate systems are examined below.

+ Certainty and stability
+ Opportunity costs
+ Currency liquidity
+ A target for speculators
