Question 5          2/2

Question 6          3/6
                    expensive to setup; inflexible; impact on current financial position

Section B

Question 8          6/10
                    You did not consider the presence of a strong competitor that holds 70% of the
                    market share, and MyT would enter a new market, meaning a market in which it has
                    no experience; this, on top of the current financial situation, makes this move
                    very risky

Section B

Question 8          5/10
                    You discarded the stimulus material. You did not consider the presence
                    of a competitor that owns 70% of market share; together with the type
                    of diagonal related grow, that would bring MyT in an unknown market, with
                    no experience about it

                    It is either avatar or influencer; the first is at 0 cost; the

Section B

Question 7          7/10
                    Beside the fact that you mixed up the two question, assuming you wanted to
                    answer the question #7, you did not consider that flow production requires
                    less workers and this solves partially the problem of the new location and
                    the workers asking to be paid more
