Section B

Question 8          6/10
                    You did not consider the presence of a strong competitor that holds 70% of the
                    market share, and MyT would enter a new market, meaning a market in which it has
                    no experience; this, on top of the current financial situation, makes this move
                    very risky

                    of diagonal related grow, that would bring MyT in an unknown market, with
                    no experience about it

Question 7          7/10
                    Beside the fact that you mixed up the two question, assuming you wanted to
                    answer the question #7, you did not consider that flow production requires
                    less workers and this solves partially the problem of the new location and
                    the workers asking to be paid more

                    of the increasing cost of labour. Also, setting up new premises, allows
