Pricing strategies
========================

| Methods | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Cost-plus pricing | <ul><li>Price set will cover all costs of production</li><li>Easy to calculate for single-product firms where there is no doubt about fixed-cost allocation</li><li>Suitable for firms that are "price makers" due to market dominance</li></ul> | <ul><li>Not necessarily accurate for firms with several products where there is doubt over the allocation of fixed costs</li><li>Does not have market/competitive conditions in to account</li><li>Tends to be inflexible, e.g., there might be opportunities to increase prices even higher</li><li>If sales fall, average fixed and averaege total cost rise - this could lead to the price neing raised using this method</li></ul>|
| Penetration pricing | <ul><li>Low prices should lead to high demand - it is important to establish high-market share for new products</li><li>If demand is high, the business may be able to raise prices after a period of time to increase profit margins</li></ul> | <ul><li>Profit margins may be very low - prices might have to increase in the future and there could be consumer resistance to this </li><li>It could start a price war - if competitors have more resources they might be able to survive this better</li><li>Low price my be perceived as being an indicator of low quality</li></ul> |
| Loss leader | <ul><li>Makes a loss on one product but this is more than compensated for by profits on other products - perhaps complementary to the loss leader</li><li>Increases market share</li></ul>| <ul><li>Cheaper generic alternatives might be sold by rival firms so the profit-making complementary products are not purchased from the loss-leading business</li></ul> |
| Predatory pricing | <ul><li>Drives down prices to benefit consumers and is likely to increase demand for the product</li><li>May reduce the number of competitors in the long term and increase monopoly power of the "predator"</li></ul> | <ul><li>It is illegal in many <hcountries and, if proven, heavy fines can be imposed</li><li>Consumers may try to find alternative products if the business achieves maket power dominance and increases prices in the long term</li><li>Consumer may perceive a lower quality product</li></ul> |
| Premium pricing | <ul><li>Helps to establish a perception of exclusivity and high brand image</li><li>Consumers might associate high prices with high quality</li></ul> | <ul><li>Will only be effectife if part of coordinate mix which helps to establish a premium image for the product</li><li>Could lead to low sales and revenues if consumers switch to lower-priced conpetitors</li></ul> |
| Dynamic pricing | <ul><li>Maximises revenue by setting different prices for different consumers</li><li>Caries the price according to market conditions and the price elasticity ad different times</li><li>Can be used to improve stock management - cut prices to sell excess stock </li><ul> | <ul><li>Requires advanced IT systems to adjust prices quickly according to changing demand levels</li><li>Consumers dislike the system as it is viewed as a form of explloitation</li><li>Consumers may be alienated if they find out some buyers have paid a much lower price</li></ul> |
| Competitive pricing |<ul><li>Helps to maintain market share and even increase sales if all businesses in the market set low prices </li><li>Avoids setting prices which are much lower than rivals' prices, which will reduce profit margins</li><li>Helps to build customer loyalty if they can be assured of receiving a competitive price </li></ul> |<ul><li>May reduce profit margins if prices are set to respond to low-priced competitors</li><li>Some rivals might have lower average costs, and pricing competitively will risk the business making a loss</li><li>Setting competitive prices below cost will risk long-term survival</li></ul> |
| Contribution pricing |<ul><li>Sets prices that could be lower than the cost-plus method so makes the business more competitive</li><li>Avoids the inaccurate allocation of fixed costs which can lead to inappropriate price</li></ul> | <ul><li>Does not include fixed costs in the pricing decision</li><li>A loss will be made if total contribution is less than fixed costs</li><li>Cannot be sustained in the long term if fixed costs are not being covered </li></ul> |
