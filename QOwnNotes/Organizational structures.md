## By Region

### Advantages

+ Communication between representatives can be very direct and personal
+ Grouping employees into regional sections can encourage the formation of strong collaborative teams that work effectively together
+ The ability to recruit local management offers companies the advantage of having leaders who are completely familiar with the local business environment
+ Better decisions can result from relying on the knowledge and experience of regional managers who are aware of specific cultural factors. 
+ Recruiting a mix of local and head office managers to lead a geographical unit has the advantage of linking local culture with company culture
+ Tracking the performance of individual regional markets is simplified under this structure

### Disadvantages

+ Duplication of personnel between head office and regional offices
+ There may be conflict and unhealthy competition between different areas
+ It could make more difficult to be consistent in core company beliefs
+ Inconsistent company strategies might be adopted in different regions as a a result of poor coordination between regional offices

## By Function

### Advantages

+ Grouping employees by  functional skills can improve efficiency. 
+ Specialists are clustered together, with promotes collaboration and the opportunity for the further development of professional expertise.
+ Employees can capitalize on their specialized skills as a means to move up the ladder in a given department+
+ As each department specializes in a specific function, managers train and develop employees within their unit to be proficient in their given role
+ 
### Disadvantages

+ Such a structure tends to suggest that one-way communication is the norm
+ There are few horizontal links between the departments
+ Managers are often accused of tunnel vision
+ This type of structure is very inflexible and often leads to change resistance

## By Product

An organizational structure based on products usually consists of several parallel teams focusing on a single product or service
An organizational structure based on product divisions gives a larger business the ability to segregate large sections of the company into semi-autonomous groups.
Unlike functional departments, product divisions tend to be more autonomous, each with its own top executive. They typically manage their own recruitment, budgeting and advertising.

### Advantages

+ Allows a team to focus on a single product or service, with an appropriate leadership structure
+ Having a senior executive, makes it more likely the division will receive the resources it needs from the company
+ A product division’s focus allows it to build a common culture and esprit de corps that contributes to higher morale and a better knowledge of the division's range of products

### Disadvantages

+ Product divisions may compete with each other for available financial resources
+ Divisions can result in compartmentalization that results in lack of coordination or even duplication of developments

## Matrix

Matrix structure: an organization that creates project teams that cut across traditional functional departments.
The matrix structure aims to eliminate many of the problems associated with the hierarchical structure.
This method of organizing a business is task focused. Instead of highlighting the role on individuals it gathers together a team of specialists with the objective of completing a task or a project successfully.

### Advantages

+ It allows total communication between all members of the team, cutting across boundaries between departments
+ There is less chance of people focusing on just what is good for their department.
+ The crossover of ideas between people with specialist knowledge in different areas then to create more successful solutions
+ As new project teams can be created quickly, this system is well designed to respond to changing markets or technological conditions

### Disadvantages

+ There is less control from the top as the teams may be empowered to undertake and complete a project. This can be difficult for some managers to accept
+ The benefit of faster reaction is at the expense of reduced bureaucratic control and this trend may be resisted by some senior managers
+ Team members may have two leaders if the business retains levels of hierarchy for departments but allows cross-departmental teams to be created


## Shamrock

The Shamrock organization is like a flower with three leafs:

+ **Core managerial and technical staff**, who must be offered full-time, permanent contracts with competitive salaries and benefits.These workers are central to the survival and growth of the organisation. In return for high rewards they are expected to be loyal and work long hours when needed.As core workers are expensive, their numbers are being reduced in most organisations.
+ **Outsourced functions by independent providers**, who may once have been employed by the company.Also known as the ‘contractual fringe’, these workers provide specific services that do not have to be kept within the core.These may include payroll services, transport, catering and IT.
+ **Flexible workers on temporary and part-time contracts**, who are called on when the situation demands their labour.As the organisation demonstrates little concern or loyalty towards these workers, they often respond in kind.These workers are most likely to lose their jobs in an economic downturn.
