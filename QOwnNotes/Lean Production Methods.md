Lean Production Methods
========================
## Simultaneous engineering

This is a method of developing new products by ensuring that essential design, market research, costing and engineering tasks are done at the same time as each other (simultaneously) – not one after the other (sequentially). The advantage of simultaneous engineering is that new products can be in the marketplace months or even years earlier than would have been the case with sequential methods.


## Flexible Specialism

+ flexible employment contracts that allow non-core workers to be called in or not employed as demand conditions change
+ flexible and adaptable machinery – often computer- controlled – that can be quickly switched from one design to another
+ flexible and multi-skilled workers able to perform different jobs on different product ranges.


## Kaizen Groups

The philosophy behind kaizen is that all workers have something to contribute to improve the way their business operates and the way the product is made. The continuous improvement philosophy suggests that, in many cases, workers actually know more than managers about how a job should be done or how productivity might be improved.


## Andon

Andon is derived from a Japanese term for a type of paper lantern. In manufacturing, andon systems provide visual feedback to the supervisors on the factory floor.Typically, andon systems indicate ‘line status’ – showing when assistance is needed (e.g. from a supervisor or when maintenance is required), and empowering employees to stop the production process when they believe that there is a quality issue (see the Toyota Setting the scene case study).


## JIT

This stock-control method aims to avoid holding stocks by requiring supplies to arrive just as they are needed in production and completed products are produced to order.

For JIT to work effectively these conditions must be met:

1.  Relationships with suppliers have to be excellent
2.  Production staff must be multi-skilled and prepared to change jobs at short notice
3.  Equipment and machinery must be flexible
4.  Accurate demand forecasts will make JIT a much more successful policy
5.  The latest IT equipment will allow JIT to be more successful
6.  Excellent employer–employee relationships are essential for JIT to operate smoothly
7.  Quality must be everyone’s priority

### Advantages

+ Capital invested in stock is reduced and the opportunity cost of stock-holding is reduced.
+ Costs of storage and stock-holding are reduced. Space released from holding of stocks can be used for a more productive purpose.
+ There is much less chance of stock becoming outdated or obsolescent. Having fewer goods held in storage also reduces the risk of damage or wastage.
+ The greater flexibility that the system demands leads to quicker response times to changes in consumer demand or tastes.
+ The multi-skilled and adaptable staff required for JIT to work may gain from improved motivation.


### Disadvantages

+ Any failure to receive supplies of materials or components in time caused by, for example, a strike at the supplier’s factory, transport problems or IT failure will lead to expensive production delays.
+ Delivery costs will increase as frequent small deliveries are an essential feature of JIT.
+ Order-administration costs may rise because so many small orders need to be processed.
+ There could be a reduction in the bulk discounts offered by suppliers because each order is likely to be very small.
+ The reputation of the business depends significantly on outside factors such as the reliability of supplying firms.

## Kanban

Japanese manufacturing system in which the supply of components is regulated through the use of an instruction card sent along the production line.

A kanban system is a means of achieving just-in-time (JIT) production. It works on the basis that each process on a production line pulls through just the number and type of components the process requires, at just the right time.The method used is a kanban card.This is usually a physical card but other devices can be used.Two kinds of kanban cards are mainly used – a withdrawal kanban and a production-ordering kanban.
