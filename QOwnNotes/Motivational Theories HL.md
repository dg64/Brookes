Having autonomy means a person's behaviour is self endorsed and that choice is self-initiated <br><br>**2 - Competence**<br>Competence refers to the capacity and confidence to learn and do things to enhance our mastery in what we desire to do and the things that are important to us.<br><br> **3 - Relatedness**<br>Relatedness refers to our connections with other people in society. Such connections provide people with a sense of security as there are feelings of love and belonging|Employees compare the ratio of their input (effort) to output (rewards), and also make such comparisons with their colleagues in order to determine their own sense of fairness. <br>In turn, this interpretation or evaluation will influence their levels of motivation.<br>People are motivated if their input (effort) is perceived to be fair (equitable) in comparison with the output (such as pay and rewards).<br><br>**Inputs**<ul><li>Adaptability (flexibility)</li><li>Commitment (loyalty)</li><li>Determination</li><li>Education</li><li>Effort (hard work)</li><li>Experience</li><li>Personal sacrifices</li><li>Skills</li><li>Support for others</li><li>Time</li><li>Tolerance</li><li>Training and development</li></ul> <br>**Outputs** <br><ul><li>Advancement (growth)</li><li>Fringe payments (perks)</li><li>Gratitude (appreciation) from others</li><li>Job satisfaction</li><li>Job security</li><li>Purpose (the opportunity to make a difference)</li><li>Recognition / praise / acknowledgement</li><li>Remuneration (wages and salaries)</li><li>Reputation</li><li>Responsibility</li><li>Salaries / wages</li><li>Sense of achievement</li><li>Status (rank)</li><li>Stimulus (engagement and interest)</li></ul>| People only put in the effort to do a task if they expect that their role will help to achieve the required result. If workers feel they lack the ability, expertise or skill to achieve a target, then their level of effort will be lower (which reflects a lower level of motivation).<br><br>**Expectancy**<br>People have different expectations about their capability and self-confidence in tackling a task. There are also different perceptions about the level of difficulty of the task.<br><br>**Instrumentality** <br>People hold the perception that if they meet performance targets then they will be rewarded accordingly (or what they think is desirable as an award). Managers must ensure that promises are kept to gain people’s trust and therefore their level of motivation.<br><br>**Valence**<br>Managers need to find out what staff value since people place different values on different rewards. Valence means rewarding people with what will give people a sense of satisfaction. In tackling a task, people consider whether it is worth any extra effort in terms of both intrinsic rewards (such as satisfaction and ego) and extrinsic rewards (such as money and promotion).<br>br>In essence, Vroom's expectancy theory of motivation advocates creating and maintaining positive links between the high level of effort (inputs) with appropriate rewards to generate high performance (outputs). Vroom expressed this as a motivation equation:<br><br>`M = E × I × V`<br><br>where<br> M = Motivation,<br> E = Expectancy,<br> I = Instrumentality, <br>V = Valence.<br><br>What this means is that if any of the three elements of motivation is too low, the level of motivation will be low. Furthermore, if any of the elements is zero (i.e., missing), then there is no motivation to do a particular job.|
