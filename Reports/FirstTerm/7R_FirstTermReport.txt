AL TOVAHIYA HANAN
********************************************************************************
Hanan is a confident and knowledgeable student. She joined the class in the late mid-term but this did not prevent her to bond with her peers and being an active member of class debates.
In her recent summative assessment about the Egyptian civilization, Anan shows good investigating and communication skills. Her work could have been improved if she was less sure of herself. Anan delivered her work far ahead of her peers and she refused repeated invitations to use the remaining time to check and revise her work.
Recommendation: Due to her late coming, Hanan has to recover some topics; she needs to take advantage of the material uploaded on Managebac to fill her gaps.

His summative assessments about the UN dealing with plastic pollution in the ocean and the most recent one, about the Egyptian civilization, show his communication ability; facts are categorized and presented clearly, with a preference for visual communication over textual one.
Recommendation: Deniz needs to focus on his investigating skills, as he usually stops his research after he found only two or three sources.

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************
NETKACHEV OLEG
********************************************************************************
Oleg is a well-mannered student who has made steady progress in Individuals and societies so far this year. He is a communicative student and he has always a proactive attitude in helping his peers; his communication level drops when he’s asked to answer some questions; his difficulties with the English language make him shy and reluctant to answer; asking him to express his idea in Russian, I could verify that he is very knowledgeable and intelligent. His previous summative assessments show some difficulties in focusing on the task given; often Oleg got lost in a specific detail, forgetting everything else. This changed in his last summative about the Egyptian civilization; where he was able to deliver a complete and finished work.
Recommendation: Oleg must improve his level of English, as this gets in the way of the realization of his full potential.


********************************************************************************
POPERECHNYI GRIGORII
********************************************************************************
Grigorii is a well-mannered student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies so far this year. His works on the UN dealing with plastic pollution in the ocean, and the most recent one, about the Egyptian civilization, show his ability to communicate his idea in a straight, minimalistic way; his ideas, examples and personal judgements are driven more by text than by images. Grigorii has collected some absences and these had an impact on his investigating skills since he wasn’t present at school when we covered the importance of primary and secondary sources.
Recommendation: Grigorii needs to raise his level of attendance and revise the material related to the difference between primary and secondary sources and the ways of evaluating them.


********************************************************************************
SEO JIYU
********************************************************************************
Jiyu is a young girl who has made significant progress in Individuals and societies during this term. Jiyu is very quiet and polite; during class debates, she offers her contribution when she is prompted. Jiuy’s summative assessment investigating the UN’s attempts to deal with water pollution was extensively researched and he supported by examples, personal evaluation and judgment. Her presentation was also very clear and consistently formatted, adding to the effectiveness of communication.
Recommendation: Jiyu must improve her level of English, as this gets in the way of her verbal communication and her bonding with other peers that are non-asiatic.

SOHAIL HAFSAH
********************************************************************************
Hafsah is a confident and charismatic student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies so far this year. She is a highly communicative student who is always willing to offer her thoughts and ideas to class discussions. Hafsah's recent summative assessment of the Egyptian civilization shows her achievements in all 4 criteria, in her poster, she presented nearly the most important aspects of the Egyptian civilization, alternating pictures and text harmoniously, thus demonstrating not only knowledge and understanding, but also the ability to communicate effectively the content learned.


Recommendation: Hafsah needs to refrain a bit from her enthusiasm, as she often starts asking questions before an explanation is given or a new argument is introduced. 


********************************************************************************
TSANGARAS ADONIS
********************************************************************************
Adonis is a confident and knowledgeable student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies so far this year. He is highly communicative and is always keen to offer his thoughts and ideas to class discussions. Adonis’ recent work on the Egyptian civilization shows that he has learned a lot about primary and secondary sources. Being a great communicator, Adonis was often used to making statements without verifying the source and its reliability; now he understands the importance to make statements supported by evidence.
Recommendation: Adonis must learn how to control his enthusiasm; he tends to speak very quickly and with a lower tone of voice; while I appreciated his enthusiasm and his politeness, I would like to see him deliver effectively his ideas and opinions.  


********************************************************************************
WANG BOTAN
********************************************************************************
Botan is a confident and charismatic student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies so far this year. She has assumed a position of leadership among the other girls in the class. Despite that, she is not as communicative as her peers; at least for what concerns the participation in class debates. Botan has a gift for planning and for creativity; during a group task, in which they were required to draw an infographic about word inequality, Botan started drafting a mockup on a small piece of paper and then she and her peers reproduced it on a bigger scale.
Recommendation: Botan needs to work on her knowledge of English, as it seems that often she needs to use Google Translate.
