HAIFA ALAHMED
********************************************************************************
Haifa closes the first term with current attainment of 4 and her attendance is attested to 100%. Haifa is a well-mannered student who started the year as an HL student; then she moved to SL and then back to HL. Her decision was based on the base assessment's poor result; the other summative assessments were absolutely different, and I am glad that Haifa has reconsidered her decision. 
During the class debates, Haifa is always ready to give her contribution and it is visible that she enjoys the lessons. In her answers Haifa shows a sound knowledge and understanding of the subject using subject-specific terminology; the answers are logically structured and coherent but not fully developed; there is some evidence of critical thinking.
Recommendation: Continue to work on analytical and evaluation skills. I see the potential to reach, at least, a 6.

JEAN CLEMENT
********************************************************************************
Jean closes the first term with current attainment of 3 and his attendance is attested to 93.75%. Jean pays the fact that she joined Brookes late in this term and he had a lot to recover. 
He has been offered additional lessons in Business Management, to help him recover his gaps, but his attendance to these lessons is sporadic. Both during normal and additional lessons Jean is often distracted and answers only when prompted to. In his answers, Jean shows some knowledge and understanding of the subject, a basic sense of structure that is not sustained throughout the answers.
Recommendation: Jean needs to become familiar with the requirements for answering business management questions; he needs also to consolidate his understanding of business management concepts and theories.

HYUNJIN KANG
********************************************************************************
Hyunjin closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and her attendance is attested to 100%. Since the very beginning, Hyunjin has shown great interest in the subject and her results were always attested to the maximum score. She immediately understood the requirements for answering a question in Business Management; Hyunjin’s answers are well structured and clear to read; she provides examples from different perspectives and her own judgment in the conclusion.
Recommendation: I would encourage Hyunjin to be more active during class debates; she is usually silent and answer only when she is asked to. She is an outstanding student, and her contribution would be a great plus for the entire class.

ALINA KARAPETOVA
********************************************************************************
Alina closes the first term with current attainment of 6 and her attendance is attested to 100%. Alina is a well-mannered student who has shown so far great interest in the subject; during the class debates, she is the first one that gives her contribution. Alina uses business management terms properly and in context, although sometimes she gives partial or incorrect definitions. In her summative assessment, there is consistent evidence of critical thinking; an ability to analyse and evaluate data or to solve problems competently. 
Recommendation: revise the topics highlighted in the feedback of the previous summative assessments, to consolidate the understanding of the topics studied so far.

ANDREY KONDRATENKO
********************************************************************************
Andrey closes the first term with current attainment of 5 and his attendance is attested to 98.08%. Andrey is a quiet, well-mannered student who has shown so far a great deal of interest in the subject; he started as an HL student, then he switched on to SL; despite that, he is always present, by his own choice,  during HL lessons, and he is even taking notes during that lessons. That admirable attitude lead me to propose to Andrey to come back to HL. I hope he will accept my proposal
In his summative assessments, Andrey gives answers well structured, though occasionally not balanced; he shows an ability to provide competent answers with some attempt to integrate knowledge and concepts; a tendency to be more descriptive than evaluative.
Andrey has the potential and the right attitude to reach higher grades and I look forward to these improvements.
Recommendation: revise the topics that were not graded with the maximum score, and revise the prerequisites for answering business management questions.

MAXIMILIAM MIFSUD BONICI
********************************************************************************
Maximilian closes the first term with current attainment of 6 and his attendance is attested to 100%. Maximilian started the academic year as an SL student in Business Management; then after seeing his result and his interest in the subject, I asked him to switch to HL. He accepted the challenge and I am very glad about that. He is an active member during the class debates; he shows good understanding and promising analytical and evaluative skills; so far he has shown better results in quantitative analysis.
Recommendation: refine the skills in qualitative analysis; reflect on the reasons why a particular strategy can be profitable but not advisable to pursue.


********************************************************************************
KIRA POLOZOVA
********************************************************************************
Kira closes the first term with current attainment of 4 and her attendance is attested to 100%. Kira pays the fact that she joined Brookes late in this term and she had a lot to recover from. Despite that, Kira has shown desire and determination to improve; she is actually taking additional business management lessons to recover her gaps.
In her summative assessments, her answers show an understanding of business management theories and concepts; but sometimes the answers are not balanced or some structural element is missing. There is also evidence of limited application of the contents to real test cases. Considering the amount of work that Kira had to keep pace with her peer, and also considering her attitude toward the subject, I am confident that she will improve.
Recommendation: get confident with the requirements for answering business management questions. Keep going with the additional lessons.

CLAUDIA WEN HUI TAN
********************************************************************************
Claudia closes the first term with current attainment of 7 and her attendance is attested to 100%. Claudia is a well-mannered student who has shown so far great interest in the subject; during the class debates she is the first one that gives her contribution; she also is the one that checks her understanding more than the other peers; this is a quality that I personally appreciate very much. 
Claudia’s answers are always balanced, provided with examples and references to the stimulus material; the business management terms are always used appropriately and in context.
Recommendation: keep up the excellent work and involve her peers with her enthusiasm for Business Management.

Matvey closes the first term with current attainment of 6 and his attendance is attested to 100%. Matvey is a quiet, well-mannered student who has shown so far great interest in the subject; during the class debates he is not as active as I would like him to be, but when he is prompted, he gives the right answer. Matvey shows a good understanding of business management concepts and theories, although sometimes he gives partial or incorrect definitions. In his summative assessments, there is consistent evidence of critical thinking, but occasionally, his answers were missing some structural element or were not balanced.
Recommendation: revise the topics highlighted in the feedback of the previous summative assessments, and revise the prerequisites for answering the questions.
