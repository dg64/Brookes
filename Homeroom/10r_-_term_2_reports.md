# 10R - Term 2 Reports

## Tubb Charlotte
Charlotte closes this term with an attendance of 90.48%. The worsening in her attendance is the only problem that I can report, since she is very consistent in her punctuality and in her observance of the school regulations about the uniform. During homeroom time she is engaged in activities with Sophia, a student with which she bonded during her recovery period. Since the previous period, Charlotte received two commendations from the English teacher and from the PE teacher. As a recommendation I would suggest Charlotte not to go below the 90% of attendance and to try to make connections with the other students as well.

## Ovchinnikiva Sophia
Sophia closes this term with an attendance of 90.48%. She is very consistent in her punctuality end in her observance of the school regulations about the uniform. During homeroom time she is engaged in activities with Charlotte, a student with which she bonded during her recovery period.  Since the last term Sophia received another rewarding note from her English teacher. As a recommendation I would advise Sophia not to collect other absences, since he just reached the minimum level acceptable, due to her unfortunate injury.

## Yang Sihan

Sihan closes this term with an attendance of 97.62%. She is a well-mannered and punctual student; one of the first coming each morning. Since the last term Sihan received two commendations from the PE teacher for her effort and perseverance. In the previous term I have reported Sihan for interacting too  much with her peer; in this term I can tell that, thanks to a new student joining the class, she started connecting with her. As a recommendation I would suggest Sihan to try to be more proactive instead of just waiting to be approached.

## Tizin David

David closes this term with an attendance of 76.19%; this low value is due to his healthy problems. David is punctual, well-mannered and with his uniform always in perfect order. During homeroom times, he may spend the time preparing for the day or interacting with his peers. He is the most active member of the class; sometimes he prepares presentations about historical topics and show them entertaining and educating me and the rest of the class with his passion. The only recommendation that I have for David is, if possible, not to collect other absences.

## Johansson Odvar

Odvar closes this term with an attendance of 78.57%. Compared to the previous term, Odvar made some discontinuous progresses; he is well-mannered, more responsible than before and also more focused. What is lacking now is consistence, as he keeps forgetting things or, occasionally, not carrying out a task given by a teacher. My recommendation for Odvar is to show is increased maturity not only on behavioral level, but in the academic effort as well.

## Lvova Anastasia

Anastasia closes this term with an attendance of 71.43%. Compared to the previous period, Anastasia is showing a slow progress, but she is still far from the minimum required for 90%. As opposed to the previous term, Anastasia is showing up for homeroom time, even though, not always. She needs to improve her academic behaviour as still teachers lament Anastasia's lack of effort.

## Shokirev Gleb

Gleb closes this term with an attendance of 95.24%. He is well-mannered and usually comes in time for homeroom time; his uniform is in order, even though I would prefer to see him wearing the blazer more often. During homeroom time Gleb interacts with his peers, especially Odvar; since the previous term I can see that Gleb has become more mature and responsible, but heeds to be more consistent as I receive both praise and complaint about him. My suggestion for Gleb is to show the grown maturity not just in behaviour but in academic effort as well.


## Popkova Stefaniia

Stefaniia is a well-presented young girl who closes this term with an attendance of 97.62%. Since the previous term, Stefaniia collected two commendation notes from the PE teacher, showcasing her preferences for physical activities. During homeroom time she is always busy getting ready for the day and, still, she does not interact more with her peers. Being more open and engaging herself in conversation with her classmates is my suggestion for Stefaniia.

## Tsvetkova Veronika

Veronika is a young charismatic lady who closes this term with an attendance of 90.48%. This is a definite improvement since the previous term, but still Veronika needs to work on her punctuality. Like other classmates, with whom she has created a bond, she received a commendation from the PE teacher, showing that the collective created goes beyond the boundaries of the homeroom time. My suggestion for Veronika is to pay more attention to her uniform and to her punctuality.

## Alugishvili Salome
Salome is a young girl who closes this term with an attendance of 100%. Like other members of her class, her punctuality has definitely improved. Salome, in particular, has shown improvement in her attitude; this has granted her a commendation from the PE teacher. Despite this improvement, Salome needs to work on her consistence, as she still gets occasionally reprimanded for futile reasons.

## Trunova Daria

Daria is a young charismatic lady who closes this term with an attendance of 97.62%. Daria is generally punctual and her uniform is always in order; during homeroom time she is often engaged in conversation or preparation for the day with her peers; Daria needs to work a little more on her behaviour as sometimes she still gets reprimand notes for futile reasons.   

## Kireeva Daria

Daria is a young, well-mannered girl who closes this term with an attendance of 100%. Daria is not new to Brookes and, upon her return, she had not problems at all to integrate herself with the rest of the class. She comes in time each morning and her uniform is always in perfect order; since her return she got several commendation notes from the PE teacher, adding up to the general success of the homeroom. My only recommendation for Daria is to keep up the good work.

## Jung Yujin

Yujin is young, well-mannered girl who closes this term with an attendance of 100%. Yujin joined Brookes in the late term, but this did not prevent her to connect with other students, inside and outside the homeroom. She also distinguished herself in PE, where the teacher awarded Yujin with a couple of commendation notes. If this is just the beginning, I look forward to see Yujin progresses in the next academic year.


## Urmyev Allen

Allen is a charismatic young men, who closes this term with an attendance of 90.48%. Allen is always punctual, polite and with the uniform in perfect order. During homeroom time is engaged in conversations with other peers or getting ready for the day; occasionally he and other two classmates help each other in case one of them didn't catch a concept or an explanation from the teacher. My advice for Allen is to not collect other absences as it is at the limit for which the school raises a red flag.

## Lysyuf Roman

Roman is a charismatic young men, who closes this term with an attendance of 85.71%. Roma has some issues with punctuality, but is always polite and with the uniform in perfect order. During homeroom time is engaged in conversations with other peers or getting ready for the day; occasionally he and other two classmates help each other in case one of them didn't catch a concept or an explanation from the teacher. My advice for Roman is to not collect other absences as his attendance is already at a concerning.
