# Third Term

# Abdulazizov Abubakar

Abubakar is a thoughtful young man who has had an unproductive year at Brookes; being a boarding student, Abubakar was always in time for homeroom, but his uniform was often not in order and I had to remind him about that quite often. Academically, the only subject in which he performed well was Russian, while in the others was significantly struggling; Abubakar also received quite a number of negative notes relative both to his behaviour and his commitment to study. I hope Abubakar will reflect about what is going to happen next year and understand that if he keeps behaving like that, there is only one possible outcome ahead of him.

# Aladwaini Eissa

Eissa is thoughtful and polite student who has had a mixed year at Brookes; while is  generally punctual for homeroom time, his uniform is not always in order; during homeroom time, Eissa is apathetic; he needs to be pushed to read and even when he takes a book, he just holds it in his hands without reading.  This behaviour is reflected also in his academic performances as in almost all subjects there is a downward trend, except for Chemistry, that he seems to enjoy. Eissa also received a number of notes lamenting the missed submission of given tasks. For the next year I wish Eissa to find back his focus and revert this downward trend; if he is really worried about exams, as he stated, he has a lot of work ahead of him.

# Berg Eleanor

Eleanor is a charismatic and communicative young woman who has had a positive start to life at Brookes. She immediately formed strong friendships with other members of the Homeroom and settled into the school community quickly. It has been pleasing to see her consistently arrive at school punctually and well dressed and she is always active during Homeroom activities. Academically, Eleanor has consistently performed well, achieving a Grade 7 across almost all subjects, leaving some room for improvement in Spanish. Outside of the classroom, Eleanor has been involved in the MUN initiative, for which he was praised by teachers. I commend Eleanor for this achievement as well and hope she continues in the same manner for the next year.

# Colonna Michelangelo

Michelangelo is a charismatic and highly communicative young man who has had a productive year here at Brookes Moscow. His approachable and friendly personality means he has formed a number of close relationships with his peers; unfortunately, punctuality is not among his pluses and he needs to improve on that. Academically, Michelangelo performed well in English, Russian, Digital Design and Individuals and Societies, while in the remaining subjects he has room for improvement. Michelangelo has got himself involved in some disciplinary issues during this year and I hope that in year 11, he will show greater maturity in certain situations to avoid any more problems.

# de Saint Victor, Inès

Inès is a charismatic and communicative young woman who has had a positive start to life at Brookes. She immediately formed strong friendships with other members of the Homeroom and settled into the school community quickly. It has been pleasing to see her consistently arrive at school punctually and she is always active during Homeroom activities. The uniform was not always in order, but I observed a definite improvement during the last term. Academically, Eleanor has consistently performed well, achieving a Grade 7 across almost all subjects, leaving some room for improvement in Mathematics, where she seems to be struggling. Outside of the classroom, Inès has been involved in the MUN initiative, for which he was praised by teachers. I commend Inès for this achievement as well and hope she continues in the same manner for the rest of the year.

# Dikbas Derya

Derya is a polite and reflective student who has had a positive year at Brookes. Punctuality and uniform have always been a problem for  Derya; communication with her peers on the other hand, has improved during the year; especially during the last term, Derya has become more communicative. Academically, Derya performed well in almost all subjects, with only Maths and English left with some room for improvement. For the next year I encourage Derya to work on her punctuality and her uniform.

# Guseynov Amir

Amir is a charismatic and highly communicative young man who has had a difficult year here at Brookes Moscow. I witnessed an improvement in his behaviour during homeroom time, as last term he became passionate about biology and he spent his reading time  with a biology book. Amir struggled with almost all subjects, except Russian, where he scored an average grade; for this reason he went through close observation twice to assess his strengths and his weaknesses; unfortunately, both times he failed to provide sufficient evidence. I encourage Amir to become more consistent in his commitment and to give substance to his words; I am sure that he has potential, but he needs to work hard to express it.

# Kananykhina Vasilissa

Vasilissa is a charismatic and communicative young woman who has made some progress during this  year here at Brookes. Being a boarding student, she usually comes in time for  Homeroom and she is always dressed smartly in the correct uniform. Academically, Vasilissa has made good progress in Biology and Art; Vasilissa received quite a number of good notes about her artistic talent, not only from the Art Teacher, but from other as well, sign that this feature of her, shows up in everything she does; beside Art, she excels also in Biology, while in other subjects she has room for improvement, like English and Mathematics. Vasilissa had also a few negative behaviour notes this year due to disciplinary issues and I would also like to see her address those next term. 

# Kim Seoyeon

Seoyeon is a polite and reflective student who has had a mixed year. She is always punctual in the morning, and her uniform is impeccable; during homeroom time Seoyeon is seldom engaged in random conversation, as she prefers either to read or prepare for the day. Academically, Seoyeon had excellent results in Mandarin, Physics and Biology; while in English and Individuals and Societies, she has a significant room for improvement; surely improving the former will help also to improve the latter. I strongly encourage Seoyeon to work on her English, as next years will become more and more difficult if she does not master that language.

# Kim Sihwan

Sihwan is a highly principled and thoughtful student who closes this year 10 with an excellent result. Always one of the first to arrive in Homeroom and immaculately dressed; Sihwan has formed a number of positive relationships with her peers in 10K but he is seldom engaged in casual conversation with his peers; on the other hand, Sihwan is always available to help his fellow students. Academically, Sihwan has excelled in Maths, Physics and Chemistry, while in English, Mandarin and Individuals and Societies, he has room for improvement. Overall a hugely successful year for Sihwan.

# Moshkov Sergei

Sergei is a polite and reflective student who has had a mixed year. He is not always punctual in the morning, but he always comes with his uniform in order; during homeroom time Sergei is seldom engaged in random conversation, as he prefers either to read or prepare for the day. Academically, Sergei had mixed results; he excels in English, Biology and Digital design, while in the other subjects he has room for improvement; especially with Spanish. I strongly encourage Sergei to work on his punctuality and to double his efforts on Maths and Spanish.

# Qi Minkai

Minkai is a polite and quiet student that struggled a lot during this year in Brookes. He did not manage to make any ties with his homeroom peers, and even outside the homeroom, he was always staying by his own; occasionally, I noticed him talking with other Asian students, but this was an exceptional occurrence; on top of that, Minkai collected a high number of absences. Academically, Minkai enjoys Maths, while struggling in English, and this negatively affects the grades on the other subjects. I wish Minkai to solve his health problems and to become more social and more communicative.

# Roux Hugo

Hugo is thoughtful and polite student who has had a mixed year at Brookes; he always came on time, with his uniform in perfect order; however, I witnessed a change in Hugo since the beginning of the year; during the first term he spent his homeroom time reading books and magazines about cars as it is a passion of his; suddenly this stopped and he became apathetic.  This behaviour is reflected also in his academic performances as in Russian, for instance, he passed from a good to an average grade; Hugo received also a number of notes lamenting the missed submission of given tasks. For the next year I wish Hugo to find back his focus and revert this downward trend.

# Samokhvalov Timur

Timur is a charismatic and highly communicative young man who has had a productive third term here at Brookes Moscow. His approachable and friendly personality means he has formed a number of close relationships with his peers and he is always an active member of the Homeroom. Timur has performed fairly well academically, considering that he joined Brookes in the Second term and he had to get accustomed to a new environment and a new way of teaching. Academically he swings from 4 to 7 in almost all subjects, but I am confident that Timur can stabilize his grades to the upper end of the range, during the next year.

# Saran Anay

Anay is a charismatic and communicative young man who has had a positive year at Brookes. He immediately formed strong friendships with other members of the Homeroom and settled into the school community quickly. It has been pleasing to see him consistently arrive at school punctually and well dressed and he is always active during Homeroom activities. Academically, Anay has consistently performed well, achieving a Grade 7 across all subjects. Outside of the classroom, Anay has been involved in the MUN initiative, for which he was praised by teachers. I commend Anay for this achievement as well and hope he continues in the same manner for the rest of the year.

# Sokolov Maxence

Maxence is a polite and reflective student who has had a mixed year. He is always punctual in the morning, and his uniform is impeccable; during homeroom time Maxence is seldom engaged in conversation with his peers, as often came with a tyred look, like he did not sleep enough. When challenged about this, he confessed his stress and fear for summatives and exams. Academically, Maxence seems to perform well in Maths, Physics and Chemistry, while humanistic subjects are more difficult for him. I strongly encourage Maxence to work on his mental well being; it is important that he finds a balance between studying and rest.

# Strycharska Marcelina

Marcelina is an engaging and communicative young woman who had a successful term at Brookes. When she joined Brookes, in the late first term, she found the step up integrating herself in a new environment; however, in time she managed to create  strong ties with her peers and to become one the more active and enthusiastic members of the homeroom. She is always punctual and generally smartly dressed. Academically, Marcelina performed fairly well in Russian and Individual and Societies, while Mathematics and Biology are two areas of improvement for her. Overall I am glad to see all the positive changes occurred in Marcelina.

#  Zaytseva Katherine

Katherine is a principled and thoughtful student who has had a very positive first term in Year 10 at Brookes. Her approachable and friendly manner means that she has formed a number of strong bonds with her classmates and it is always pleasing to see her arrive at school with a positive attitude. Academically, Katherine has performed very well this year, achieving high grades across all subjects, leaving some room for improvement in French. During the year, Katherine received a number of praises from different teachers, emphasizing her commitment and her attitude to help her peers. Overall a hugely successful year and she should be proud of her achievements this year.
