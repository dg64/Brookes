Question 2      4/4

Question 3      4/5
                Your calculations were correct; why didn't you write the opening and

Question 4      6/6
                Changing location is not a solution that you can execute immediately,

                Increasing revenue is incorrect! Here we are concerned with cash.
                The company needs to increase sales for cash. 
                This is a dance school, which structure do you expect it has?
                There are no middle and senior managers.

                If you apologize for this, next time I expect a 6 from you.

Question 2      1/4
                Profit here is not important, cash is.
                Possible answers: poor credit control, too much credit to customers,
                lack of planning, overtrading, unexpected expenses

Question 3      4/5
                You made a mistake with the opening in April

Question 4      1/6
                Again here we are not concerned by profit, but only with the availability
                of cash.
                Ways of improving the cash flow:
                sell dance courses for cash (customers might leave and find another school
                where they can pay for credit)
                giving a discount to customers that pay in cash (your profits will suffer)
                sell some assets for cash (you may loise efficiency)
