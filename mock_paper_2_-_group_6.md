		d		6/10
				I can not accept the second method.
				Another option is arbitration/conciliatioh, but it requires time,
				or non-strike agreement, but the owner needs to be ready to negotiate

Question 5

		a		2/2

		b		2/4
				One possible disadvantage is that often the mission statement is vague

		c		2/4
				in both your cases the source must share the ethical value of CH; this is
				not something that you can overlook.

		d		3/10
				Your analysis is wrong and you contradict yourself in the advantages and
				disadvantages.
				As CH is the bigger producer; discontinuing the product will case a raise
				in price, as the other competitors are not ready to match the production
				capacity of CH. For this reason, CH will sell its stock at a bigger price.
				In the disadvantages, the fact that others companies are not ready to produce
				the anti-venom vaccina is meaningless, as you must keep the perspective of CH
				and not the perspective of the competition

		c		4/4

		d		1/10
				Your analysis is incorrect. You should have referenced the different options
				for sorting out a conflict in an employee/employees relationship; two possible
