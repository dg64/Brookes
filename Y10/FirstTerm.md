## First Term

## Saran Anay
Anay closes this term with an attendance of 95.49%. He is a young gentleman, well mannered, punctual and with the uniform always in order. During homeroom time, Anay is engaged in reading or in helping his peers with their studies; he does not seem to have a preferred friend, but he keeps good relationships with all his peers. From the academic perspective, Anay has received so far a number of praises from different teachers, showcasing a general positive attitude towards the study.

## de Saint Victor, Inès

Inès closes this term with an attendance of 98.10%. She always comes in time for homeroom, and her uniform is always in order. Inès has settled down well with the other peers, even though she has one preferred classmate with which she is engaged in extracurricular activities. Her academic performance is outstanding, with special praise from the Russian teacher, for her progress and from the I&S teacher, for delivering an exceptional essay.

## Berg Eleanor

Eleanor closes this term with an attendance of 98.72%. She always comes in time for homeroom, and her uniform is always in order. Eleanor has settled down well with the other peers, even though she has one preferred classmate with which she is engaged in extracurricular activities. Her academic performance is outstanding, with special praise from the Russian teacher and from the science teacher for her progress, and one particular mention from the I&S teacher for her time management.

## Kuzemtseva Anna

Anna closes this term with an attendance of 86.04%. Even though punctuality seems to be a bit of a problem for her, her uniform is always impeccable and she managed to settle down with all her peers in the homeroom. From the academic perspective, she performs well, but sometimes she struggles to meet deadlines and deliver the expected homework on time. The low level of attendance is also a concerning point that needs to be addressed in order to not nullify the good work done by her so far.

## Zaytseva Katherine

Katherine is a young charismatic girl that closes this term with an attendance of 96.91%. Katherine is always on time for homeroom and with the uniform in perfect order; she managed to settle down with her homeroom peers, in particular with a group of girls, which helps from time to time. This friendship hinders sometimes the academic learning process that is otherwise a display of excellent performances in Media and in English, while in Maths and I&S she seems to struggle to meet deadlines.

## Strycharska Marcelina

Marcelina is a quiet and polite student that closes this term with an attendance of 98.30%. Despite having joined Brookes late, she managed to settle in and create strong ties with some of her homeroom peers; she is also always punctual and respectful of the Brookes rules about the uniform. From the academic perspective, while Marcelina performs fairly well in Language and Literature, I&S and in ISS, she seems to struggle with Maths, making this a point of improvement for her.

## Dikbas Derya

Derya is a young charismatic girl that closes this term with an attendance of 97.39%. Derya is very sociable, and she managed to form a number of positive relationships in the homeroom. During homeroom time is always busy, either reading or helping a peer or getting ready for the day. From the academic perspective, she is an enthusiastic student of Spanish but also teachers of Science and I&S praise her for her commitment and her positive attitude.

## Kananykhina Vasilissa

Vasilissa closes this term with an attendance of 93.63%. She is a social and charismatic person; she created quite a number of strong ties with some of her peers  in homeroom; when she is engaged in some group activities, she often takes the leading role. From the academic perspective, Vasilissa shows great potential in media and arts, where she received praises from the teachers; however, in other subjects like maths for example, she needs to put more effort.

## Qi Minkai

Minkai is a quiet gentleman that closes this term with an attendance of 90.87%. Minkai is well mannered and his uniform is always in order; he needs to work on his punctuality as it seems that he has problems to be consistently punctual for homeroom time. Most of the time Minqai is by himself, maybe because of his English or because he is shy; I suggested that he gets in touch with other Chinese students, to break the ice and get around the language barriers, but he does not seem to be motivated to do that. Unfortunately, this attitude reflects negatively on academic performance, as many teachers have reported Minkai not following instructions and not carrying out the tasks assigned. An additional support in English may be beneficial for Minqai, but his attitude is key to the success of efforts done to help him.

## Roux Hugo

Hugo is a quiet and polite young man who closes this term with an attendance of 96.88%. Hugo excels in punctuality, as I do not remember one single day for him coming late, and his uniform is always in perfect order. Hugo managed to make a number of relationships with his peers, however, most of the time he prefers to be engaged in reading activities. From the academic perspectives, Hugo performs well in Chemistry, where he received praises from the teacher; unfortunately the same does not apply for I&S and English, where teachers report a low engagement; this is for sure a point of improvement for Hugo.

## Izmagilov Migel

Migell is a charismatic young man that closes this term with an attendance of 85.28%. Migel has settled down very well in the homeroom, being very sociable and talkative; sometimes too much. His uniform is always in order, but he struggles with punctuality; his level of attendance is another point of concern and needs to be addressed. From the academic perspective, Migel shows an inconsistent pattern; he has potential in Media, I&S and English, and the praises given by the teachers prove this. However, the same teachers report from time to time lack of effort or disrupting behaviours. Miguel definitely needs to work on his consistency.

## Nazarov Daniil

Daniil closes this term with an attendance of 98.24%. Being a boarding student, he is one of the early birds for homeroom time. Daniil settled down very well with his classmates, however, during hometime he often prefers to read or work with his laptop. Usually this would be a positive aspect, but with Daniil it seems that he is dependent on his laptop, I would suggest he should broaden his network of connections instead of having the laptop as the only means of engagement. Academically Daniil started well, receiving praises from the Chemistry teacher and from the English teacher; this trend unfortunately did not last long and I started to receive negative feedback from the same teachers and from others as well. Daniil needs to reflect on his current attitude and how this is negatively impacting his academic performance.

## Abdulazizov Abubakar

Abubakar closes this term with an attendance of 83.64%. Being a boarding student, he is one of the early birds for homeroom time. Abubakar settled down very well with his classmates, however, during hometime he often prefers to read or work with his laptop. The low level of attendance is concerning and needs to be addressed. Academically Abubakar started well, receiving praises from the I&S teacher and from the English teacher; this trend unfortunately did not last long and I started to receive negative feedback from the same teachers and from others as well. Abubakar needs to reflect on his current attitude and how this is negatively impacting his academic performance.

## Guseynov Amir

Amir  closes this term with an attendance of 80.60%. Considering that he is a boarding student, this level of attendance raises a concern that needs to be addressed. During homeroom time Amir is engaged in conversation with his peers or with reading, when he is reminded to do that. From the academic point of view, the general feedback from the teachers is not positive, as Amir collected several notes from different teachers about his lack of commitment. Amir needs to seriously reflect about the impact of that his attitude is going to have on his future.

## Sokolov Maxence
Maxence closes this term with an attendance of 95.49%. He is a young gentleman, well mannered, punctual and with the uniform always in order. During homeroom time, Maxence is engaged in reading or in helping his peers with their studies; he does not seem to have a preferred friend, but he keeps good relationships with all his peers.  From the academic perspective, Maxence performs well in Chemistry, while in Mandarin and in English he does not show the same level of commitment, and this is a sure point of improvement for him.

## Moshkov Sergei

Sergei is a quiet and polite young man who closes this term with an attendance of 96.88%. Sergei excels in punctuality, as I do not remember one single day for him coming late, and his uniform is always in perfect order. Sergei managed to make a number of relationships with his peers, however, he has created a strong bond with a peer in particular, with whom he spends homeroom time sharing a reading or getting ready for the day. From the academic perspective, Sergei received praise from the English teacher for his attitude; unfortunately, the same can not be said for Spanish and I&S, where Sergey must work on his consistency.

## Colonna Michelangelo

Michelangelo is a young charismatic man who closes this term with an attendance of 92.13%. Michelangelo comes to school with his uniform always in order, however, punctuality is one of his weaknesses and several times he has been reminded about the need to come to school in time; another point to address for Michelangelo is his general lack of commitment, both during homeroom time and lesson time as well. He needs to be constantly reminded to be engaged in some activity during homeroom time; also teachers complain about his lack of commitment during the lessons or the completion of assigned homework. Being a Y10 student, Michelangelo is expected to have a more mature behaviour.
