# Second term


## Aladwaini Eissa

Eissa is a quiet and polite student that closes this term with an attendance of 88.89%. Despite having joined Brookes late, he managed to settle in and create strong ties with some of her homeroom peers; he is also always punctual and respectful of the Brookes rules about the uniform, even though sometimes it seems distracted. From the academic perspective, while Eissa performs satisfactorily in English and in Russian, he seems to struggle with Maths, making this a point of improvement for him.

## Samokhvalov Timur

Timur is a charismatic student that closes this term with an attendance of 86.11%. Despite having joined Brookes late, he managed to settle in and create strong ties with some of her homeroom peers; he is also always punctual and respectful of the Brookes rules about the uniform. Each morning he comes in a good mood and his attitude has a good influence on his peers. From the academic perspective, Timur performs quite well in any subject, with media, maybe being the one subject where he finds the step up. Given his general attitude, it would not be a problem for him to improve.

## Kim Sihwan

Sihwan closes this term with an attendance of 97.2%. He is a young gentleman, well mannered, punctual and with the uniform always in order. During homeroom time, Sihwan is engaged in reading or in studying; he does not seem to have a preferred friend, but he managed to form strong ties with his peers, despite the fact that he joined Brookes after the new year. From the academic perspective, Sihwan performs well in visual art, phe and english, while with science and maths seems to find the step us and this is a point of improvement for him

## Kim Seoyeon
Seoyeon is a quiet and polite student that closes this term with an attendance of 100%. Despite having joined Brookes late, she managed to settle in and create strong ties with some of her peers, outside the homeroom; she is also always punctual and respectful of the Brookes rules about the uniform, even though sometimes it seems tired in the morning. From the academic perspective, while Seoyeon performs well in math, she seems to struggle with English and other subjects in which the knowledge of English language is a requirement. Seoyeon needs to work on her English, in order to perform well also in the other subjects..

## Qi Minkai
Minkai closes this term with an attendance of 77,78; the variance between attendance for homeroom time and attendance for classes shows that Minkai has trouble coming in time at school in the morning. Since the previous term, Minqai greatly improved his social skills, since now he does not spend his breaks apart and alone from the others. Unfortunately, this progress is not reflected in English and in I&S, a subject in which the knowledge of English language is a requirement;this is definitely a point of improvement for Minkai, while in Math, on the other hand, he performs quite well. 

## Kananykhina Vasilissa

Vasilissa closes this term with an attendance of 91.89%. As in the previous term, Vassilissa showcased her features of leadership and talent for the art; during an activity promoted by our school’s psycholog, Vassilissa easily produced a fine piece of drawing. From the academic perspective, it is evident that Vasilissa excels in subjects that require creativity, while she is still struggling with Math and French. I would normally suggest students to improve in the subjects in which they are struggling, but in the case of Vassilissa, I think that she must pursue her talent and express her potential, as long as she reaches a passing grade in the other subjects.

## Dikbas Derya

Derya is a quiet girl that closes this term with an attendance of 89.19%. During this term, Derya struggled to come in time for homeroom and with her uniform in perfect order; this is a point of improvement for her. Her relationship with other homeroom pears are always strong and she is always ready to help. Academically she confirms her commitment and her attitude toward studies with a general good level of grades, with a clear preference for foreign languages.

## Abdulazizov Abubakar

Abubakar closes this term with an attendance of 89.19%. While the level of attendance has improved from the previous term, the same I can not report for this behaviour during homeroom time, as Abubakar looks more unfocused, prone to talk instead of reading or doing his homework. From the academic point of view, the only grade that is acceptable is in PHE, while with the others he definitely needs to improve and for this reason I suggest he make good use of homeroom time and seek help from those students who are actually helping other peers.

## Roux Hugo

Hugo closes this term with an attendance of 89.19. During this term Hugo consistently came in time for homeroom, like in the previous term, but his attitude has changed; while before he preferred to read magazines about a passion of his - cars - now he is more engaged in talking with his peers. From the academic perspective, Hugo was involved in an accident related to academic honesty and I really hope he learnt from that mistake; Hugo performs well in Visual Art, Russian and English, but he definitely needs to improve his English as it is impacting other subjects, like I&S, for instance.

## Sokolov Maxence

Maxence is a quiet and polite young man who closes this term with an attendance of 89.19%. Maxence always comes in time and with the uniform in order; during homeroom time, compared with the previous term, he spends more time in social interactions than in reading activities. From the academic perspective, Maxence performs fairly well in all subjects, except English and Mandarin, where he must put more effort to bring them up with the other subjects. 

## Moshkov Sergei

Sergei closes this term with an attendance of 94.59%. For homeroom, he usually comes in time and with the uniform in order; the dynamics with other peers has not really changed since the previous term, and Sergei spends homeroom time either reading or socializing with his peers. From the academic perspective, Sergei performs well in almost all the subjects, except Spanish, where he seems to find the step up. Unfortunately this last aspect also  hasn’t changed from the previous term, and Sergei should reflect on the choice of foreign language.

## Guseynov Amir

Amir closes this term with an attendance of 86.49%; this is an improvement if compared with the attendance of the previous term, but it is still below 90% and thus needs to be considered as a point of concern. During homeroom time I noticed a relevant change in Amir, since he is often engaged in reading a book about biology; Amir actually reserves more time for reading activities than the canonical two days per week scheduled. From the academic perspective, Amir still struggles a lot with Math and with English, and unfortunately these reflect negatively on the other subjects as well. Despite that, it is my opinion that he can considerably improve, if he manages to find his focus.

## Nazarov Daniil

Daniil closes this term with an attendance of 97.30%. During this term, Daniil has been consistent in his punctuality and in his morning routine; it is still hard to get him detached from his laptop for seeing him reading a book. From the academic point of view, Daniil is inconsistent in his performances; he does well in Russian, Chemistry and Digital Design, while he struggles with Math and I&S. Unfortunately, Beside this point of improvement, Daniil was involved in an accident related to academic honesty and I hope he learnt from that mistake and he will not look for an easy fix in the future.

## Colonna Michelangelo

Michelangelo closes this term with an attendance of 86.49%, which shows a downward trend, compared with the attendance of the previous term; punctuality also is still a point of improvement for him. On the positive side I can say that Michelangelo has shown a surprisingly caring attitude towards his peers; he received praise from the I&S teacher for that, and I have myself witnessed him helping a fellow student, during a cover. From the academic perspective, Michelangelo performs well in Russian I&S and Media, while he is struggling with Spanish. Unfortunately, Michelangelo was also involved in an accident related to academic honesty and I hope i learnt from that mistake and will not look for an easy fix in the future

## Zaytseva Katherine

Katerina closes this term with an attendance of 86.49%, which is a value that should be raised at, at least, 90%. For this term, Catherine confirms her characteristic punctuality and adherence to the school regulations for the uniform. During homeroom time she either reads or helps her fellow peers with some tasks; her positive attitude and commitment are testified by several praises given by teachers. Academically, Katherine performs well in all subjects, except French, where she seems to be complacent; even the French teacher suggested a way for her to improve, and Katherine should follow that advice.

## de Saint Victor, Inès

Inès is a young charismatic girl that closes this term with an attendance of 97.30%. During this term, Inès has been consistent with her good behaviour and punctuality. She is an active member of the homeroom class and, together with another peer, she is often engaged with activities that benefit the school community. From the academic perspective,  Inès shows the same consistency, with excellent results in almost all subjects, with Math being her only soft spot. I tried to investigate with her the reason for this struggle and she told me that she knows what the problem is and that she is acting upon it, so I am confident to see some improvements in the near future.

##i Berg Eleanor
Eleanor is a young charismatic girl that closes this term with an attendance of 97.30%. During this term, Eleanor has been consistent with her good behaviour and punctuality. She is an active member of the homeroom class and, together with another peer, she is often engaged with activities that benefit the school community. From the academic perspective,  Eleanor shows the same consistency, with excellent results in almost all subjects. Since she has strong ties with a student that is also a high performer, but is struggling with one subject; I would suggest Eleanor to use this friendship to help that student.

## Strycharska Marcelina

Marcelina closes this term with an attendance of 81.08%, which is a bit too below the required 90%, and thus needs to be improved. From the previous term, Marcelina strengthened her ties with her fellow peers and now she is more engaged in activities that benefit the school community. From the academic perspective, Marcelina excels in Spanish and in Russian; she shows a slight improvement in Math, while in Biology she is still struggling; and this is her point of improvement for the next term.

## Saran Anay

Anay is a young gentleman that closes this term with an attendance of 94.59%. Since the previous term, he has been consistent in punctuality, behaviour and dress code; Anay never wastes his time as he is either studying, reading, or helping his fellow classmates. From the academic perspective  Anay is one of the top performers in all subjects; only in French he has a small room for improvement. To sum up, it is very pleasant to see such a student that shares his time and skills with others, showing talent and care at the same time.
