## Katarina

Question 1      1/2
                It is not the cost, it is the price.
                If the asset can not be sold at that price at the end
                of its life, then it will be recorded as a cost

Question 3      2/3
                You did not include the scrap value

Question 4      3/4
                You did not include the scrap value

Question 5      5/10
                This answer is unbalanced and lacks of one element, the
                conclusion.
                I am giving you half the point, this time, but be aware 
                that the correct score for such an answer is 3 point.

Question 5      7/10
                Staff is already leaving the company, meaninig that the motivation
                is very low; an investment that shows that the company is going
                towards the direction o machine intensive process, will make them
                feel less needed and the problem of staff retention will worsen
