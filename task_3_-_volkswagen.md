# Task 3 - Volkswagen

Introduction
Volkswagen Group is a Public Limited Company founded in 1937 in Wolfsburf, Lower Saxony. From 2016 to 2019 Volkswagen was rated as the largest by sales car manufacturer worldwide.
The group includes several brands, spanning from all car segments, bike, and commercial vehicles. 
This essay will focus on the Volkswagen brand, its past and current issues related to Corporate Social Responsibility.
In September 2015, Volkswagen was at the center of a scandal (Trellis) about the falsification of CO2 emissions of its diesel car; the tampering was discovered in the USA, and then the effects reverberated in Europe as well. This scandal happened just after the recognition by Down Jones as Volkswagen being the best in class for sustainability. As a consequence of this scandal, the share price fell down by more than 35% of its value and the by-then CEO Martin Winkerton, stepped down from his role.
The goal of this essay is to analyze the practice known as "green washing", the strategy adopted by Volkswagen to recover from this scandal and the actual issues connected with Corporate Social Responsibility that Volkswagen is still facing.


Analysis

Green washing
By "green washing" we mean the untruthful commitment of companies in Corporate Social Responsibility. (nrdc)
Thinking about Volkswagen and its brand recognition, the first questions that comes to mind is why? Why a company like Volkswagen decided to adopt a deceptive marketing strategy that, in the end, cost $40 billion? The quick answer to this question is: "because it sells". Claiming to be "green" leverages on the increased sensibility of consumers about environmental issues. The source referenced above mentions a number of cases of companies using green washing in their marketing strategy; the variety of companies mentioned shows also that this is a spread phenomena, not just restricted to a single market.
On this scenario, the scandal of Volkswagen appears less exceptional and it looks more like the one among many that was caught cheating, while all the others kept their "green washing" strategy.

The day after (management weekly)
Recovering from such a scandal is no joke, but it sees that Volkswagen managed to do it. The first step of this recovery was, of course, the reformulation of the vision statement and the mission statement. The company teamed up with Microsoft Germany to work together on sustainability initiatives. Since the scandal originated in the US, this strategic alliance appears as a smart move to regain the reputation lost in the US market, by cooperating with one of the most famous American companies.
The reformulation of the vision and vision statement implied a change in the corporate culture and this change was one of the three points of the evolution of the Volkswagen brand, in the years following the scandal (Forbes).

3 Point changes

1 - Technology shift. Since the engine diesel was at the heart of the scandal, Volkswagen ditched the diesel engine, to embrace e-mobility (electric vehicles).
2 - Policy shift. Volkswagen took an active role and became one of the CSR policy makers, cooperating with NGOs and advocating for ambitious standards.
3 - Cultural shift. Moving from an old fashioned company, driven only by profit, to becoming a social enterprise operating according the three sustainable principles of People Planet and Profit.

Volkswagen today
Volkswagen  has gone a long way since 2015, and today Corporate Social Responsibility seems to be fully integrated in its culture. Volkswagen releases detailed yearly reports about its environmental objectives and its supply chain. Since the audit reports about CSR can not be externally verified and certified, like the accounting reports, I will concentrate on the supply chain and sourcing material report. The numbers shown on this report are key to explain why Volkswagen is experiencing serious financial and CSR issues.
