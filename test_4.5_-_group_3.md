		I do not think that TV advertising is appropriate for this type of business.
		KOY is very careful about fixed costs and they want to keep a low price in order

		that is too broad for the needs of KOY. Other form of ATl would be more suitable,
		like local radios, or brochures. The drawback is that they have to update frequently
		their advertising as they are continuosly moving from venue to venue
