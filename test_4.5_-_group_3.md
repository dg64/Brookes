Question 4	8/10
		I do not think that TV advertising is appropriate for this type of business.
		KOY is very careful about fixed costs and they want to keep a low price in order
		to attract customers. TV is the most expensive media of promotion and has a reach
		that is too broad for the needs of KOY. Other form of ATl would be more suitable,
		like local radios, or brochures. The drawback is that they have to update frequently
		their advertising as they are continuosly moving from venue to venue

Question 5	2/4
		Here you missed the fact that this school is surrounded by competitors. Promotion is
		necessary to make this school stand among the others

Question 3	0/4
		The business is not a product. You can  not say that a business is in a specific
		stage of the product life cycle. The product is. In the case of KOY the product/service
		is course of martial art. When the course starts it is in the introduction phase; there
		are few customers, when the number of customers increases the course enters the growth phase;
		when the course is in advanced stage, it means that it is in the maturity phase; no more customers
		will join the course at this point; when the course is about to finish, it enters the decline
		phase.
