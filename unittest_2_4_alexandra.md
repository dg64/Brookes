Question 1	2/2

Question 2	4/4

Question 3	2/4
		Your reference of Herzeberg is incorrect; the appraisal schema is related to motivator factors, not to
		hygiene factors. Feedback is one of the component of job enrichment, which gives motivation, according to
		Herzberg. You also discarded the fact that the employee still keep their fringe benfit, leaving
		their status unchanged; this is related to the acknowledgment level of Maslow

Question 4	7/10
		I do not see here any reference to motivational theories. What about Adam and Vroom?
