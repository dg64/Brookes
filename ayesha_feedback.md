# Ayesha feedback

the research question iss focused but not aligned with the business. A company thata 0.0016% of market share does not have the problem to
maintain or increase the market share; the problem is more about customer retention since the market share is so low.
There is partial understanding of the business tools and concepts referenced; a cafe can only have direct distribution, as it works with customers visiting it.
Break even point is mentioned but not used; no data about level of sales and costs are provided; the cost plus strategy is listed both as a strenght and as a 
weakness. No accounting information is provided, concerning gross profit margin, net profit margin and/or liquidity ratio. So there is no way to suggest any
course of action, and actually the conclusion does not answer the research question.
In the reflections and limitations is mentioned the utilization of the STEEPLE analysis, but no mention is made about missing accounting data.
