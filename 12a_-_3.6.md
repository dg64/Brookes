Question 3      1/2
                One A/P is incorrect

Question 4      4/6
                Decreasing the creditor days means that working capital cycle becomes bigger,
                meaning that the company will need more cash; this can be proposed only if
                if the supplier agrees to a discount that neutralizes for the firm the need
                of more cash

Question 5      2/6
                The decreasing in the gearing ratio is a positive factor as the non-current
                liabilities haven't increased as well. The company is quicker in receiving
                cash and slower to pay its supplier, but we can see also that the stock
                turnover has decreased, suggesting that now they are buying more raw-material,
                and this increase the amount of cash tied in stock

Question 5      2/6

                and this increase the amount of cash tied in stock
                The company has increased the amount of retained profit invested into the business
                and this lowered the gearing ratio; unfortunately, this investment is not matched
                by an increase in efficiency.

                Good that you referenced the Gross and Net Profit Margin, but which one got worse
                from Y1 to Y2? And which managers can you blame for that?

Question 4      4/6
                The long term liabilities did not change and this is positive; the cash injected
                into the company are increased, that lead to a decrease in the gearing ratio.
                Which manager would you make redundant?

                The long term liabilities did not change, meaning the firm is paying
                the same amount of interest like the year before.
                Numbers must be mentioned and explained. Adjectives as fine, good, bad,
                have no place in an analysis.
