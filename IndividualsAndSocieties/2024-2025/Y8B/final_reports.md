# Final Reports

## Akhundova, Leyla
Leyla is a communicative student who has made some limited progress in Individuals and societies this year. When engaged in the content, Leyla enjoys the lessons and will offer some interesting ideas to class discussions; the issue throughout the year for Leyla has been in her tendency to be distracted and to distract her peers with conversations. This has negatively impacted the consistency of her performance.

Recommendation:
I would encourage Leyla to be more focused during the lessons, in the next year.
She should also improve her writing and critical thinking skills, including all the necessary elements of an extended answer (introduction, balanced analysis, and conclusion), and providing coherent arguments

## Bird, Elliott
Elliott is a polite and diligent student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies this year. Elliott is always focused during the lesson; he carries out written tasks diligently and efficiently; Elliott has made good connections with his peers, and he enjoys working in a team. He is an active participant in class discussions and he has been consistently delivering good results throughout the academic year.

Recommendation: 
My suggestion for Elliot  is to improve his writing skills using a more formal register. 
He should also be careful to include all the necessary elements of an extended answer (introduction, balanced analysis, and conclusion)

## Davydova, Roza
Roza is a communicative student who has made some progress in Individuals and societies this year. When engaged in the content, Roza enjoys the lessons and will offer some interesting ideas to class discussions. The issue throughout the year for Roza has been in her tendency to be distracted and to distract her peers with conversations. This, paired with some absences,  has negatively impacted the consistency of her performance and prevented her from reaching the maximum score, especially talking about the “Knowledge and Understanding” criteria.

Recommendation:
I would encourage Roza to be more focused during the lessons, in the next year.
She should also improve her attendance, since it seems that she is unable to recover the gap from her own.

## de Saint Victor, Roch
Roch is a charismatic and communicative student who has made some steady progress in Individuals and societies this year. When engaged in the lesson content, Roch is keen to participate in class discussions and always offers interesting topics for discussion. Despite some absences, Roch managed to keep the pace with his peers and perform well during the last summative.

Recommendation: 
Roch needs to improve his critical thinking skills and provide evaluations that are more balanced.
Roch should also look to develop his explanations further, using a broader range of real world examples to support his points, he often presents good arguments but he does not elaborate them well enough.

## Goel, Allen
Allen is a polite and diligent student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies this year. Allen is always focused during the lesson; he carries out written tasks diligently and efficiently; Allen has made good connections with his peers, and he enjoys working in a team, but it seems that he expresses his potential better when he works alone. He is an active participant in class discussions and he has been consistently delivering good results throughout the academic year.

Recommendation: 
My suggestion for Allen is to use his ability to focus, together with his social skills, so that he can assume a role of leadership when there are groupwork assignments. 
I would also encourage Allen to maintain his excellent track record of meeting all assignments

## Golubeva, Marianna
Marianna is a polite and charismatic student who has settled in well to the class since joining earlier this term. After an initial period in which Marianna found the step up, she managed to make good connections with her peers; she enjoys the subject and always provides meaningful contribution during class discussions. Her final grades are affected by her late joining, but I am sure that in the next year, Marianna will easily reach the top score.

Recommendation:
Marianna should improve her handwriting as sometimes it is difficult to read and understand what she writes.
She should also be careful to include all the necessary elements of an extended answer (introduction, balanced analysis, and conclusion)

## Karakaya, SELINA-KHALISE
Selina is an enthusiastic and hard-working student who has made very good progress in Individuals and societies this year. She works diligently on written tasks and even though she lost some lessons, Selina managed to keep the pace with her peers. She managed to make good connections with her peers, and during class debates she is always eager to give her contribution.

Recommendation: 
I encourage Selina to keep up the good work.
As a next step of her growth, I would suggest Selina to restrain herself from overdoing. For the last summative Selina wrote a long answer for a question that was worth only 2 points. While this denotes her level of knowledge, it may become detrimental as it subtracts time from answering other questions that need more elaboration.

## Kostochka, Alexander
Alexander is a polite and principled student who has made steady progress in Individuals and societies this year. Although quiet in lessons, Alexander works diligently on written tasks and his answers show a good level of critical thinking. Despite several absences, Alexander always kept a proactive attitude and managed to keep the pace with his peers; however, I am sure that, should Alexander had been able not to lose any lessons, his result would be at the top of the score.

Recommendation: 
As a general suggestion I would encourage Alexander to consolidate his communication and critical thinking skills.
Alexander needs to work on his handwriting as, sometimes, it is really difficult to understand what he writes.

## Moenke, Marek
Marek is a polite and diligent student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies this year. He is one of the most active members during class debates; his analyses are balanced and argumented.  During this year, Marek has shown to be very reflective, as in general, all of his questions have an evaluational goal; this is reflected in the excellent results that he achieved at the end of the academic year.

Recommendation: 
I encourage Marek to keep up the good work. 
As a next step of his growth, I would suggest Marek to become more of a risk taker, as sometimes his reflective attitude works as a restraint.

## Mukhametshin, Emile
Emile is a quiet yet diligent student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies this year. Although he does not often offer his thoughts and opinions in class, his written works show evidence of satisfactory knowledge and critical thinking skills. Communication, however, seems to be a problem for Emile, both in written and in oral form; as previously stated, Emile does not offer willingly his contribution during class debates, but he needs to be explicitly asked; as for the writing, his answers, often lack some elements, like a conclusion, or a direct reference to the question answered.
Recommendation: 
For the next year I suggest Emile to work on his communication skills and I encourage him to be more proactive during class debates
Emile should also refine his writing skills, referring explicitly to the question answered and including all the structural elements of an extended answer (introduction, balanced analysis and conclusion)

## Puginskaya, Arina
Arina is a communicative student who has made some limited progress in Individuals and societies this year. When engaged in the content, Arina offers some ideas to class discussions, but very seldom does that by her own initiative. The issue throughout the year for Arina  has been in her decreasing interest in the subject; preferring to chat instead of paying attention to what was explained. This has negatively impacted the level of her performance.

Recommendation:
I would encourage Arina to reflect on her attitude and her priorities. The next years are going to be more challenging than the one just passed and she does not seem to care about learning.
She should also be careful to include all the necessary elements of an extended answer (introduction, balanced analysis, and conclusion)

## Rangi, Tamatea
Tamatea is a confident and communicative student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies this year. He regularly contributes to class discussions and enjoys  teamwork assignments.  Tamatea always carries out his written tasks on time; however, when finished, Tamatea has the tendency to distract or be distracted in conversation with his peers.

Recommendation: 
Tamatea should consolidate his critical thinking skills, taking care of providing balanced analysis with examples that support his ideas.
He should also be careful to include all the necessary elements of an extended answer (introduction, balanced analysis, and conclusion)


## Shevnin, Nikolai
Nikolai is a polite and quiet student who has made good progress in Individuals and societies this year. He gives his contribution in class debates when engaged, and he managed to form strong ties with his peers. In his written works, Nikolay shows satisfactory knowledge and critical thinking skills, however, he needs to improve his communication skills both oral and written.

Recommendation:
I would encourage Nikolai to be more proactive during class debates and start providing his contribution without being asked to.
He should also refine his writing skills, referring explicitly to the question answered and including all the structural elem

## Sin, Jeongwoo

During this year, Jeongwoo has shown to be very reflective, as in general, all of his questions have an evaluational goal; this is reflected in the excellent results that he achieved at the end of the academic year.

As a next step of his growth, I would suggest Jeongwoo to become more of a risk taker, as sometimes his reflective attitude works as a restraint.

## Strycharska, Antonina
Antonina is a polite and communicative student who has made steady progress in Individuals and societies this year. Although she joined Brookes in the late first term, she managed to make good ties with her peers and to quickly recover the gap. Antonina  works diligently on written tasks and participates in class discussions when engaged. Despite some absences, Antonina managed to get a good score, however, I advise against missing so many lessons in the next year.

Recommendation: 
My suggestion for Antonina is to focus on other ATL skills, than communication and being more focused during lessons
She should also be careful to include all the necessary elements of an extended answer (introduction, balanced analysis, and conclusion)

## Tho, Onyu
Onyu is a highly principled and hard-working student who has made very good progress in Individuals and societies this year. She works diligently on written tasks and her organization and self-management skills are unmatched. Onyu has consistently delivered excellent results throughout the entire year, and the last summative wasn’t any different. She managed to make good connections with her peers, even though she seems to be shy when it comes to participating in class debates.

Recommendation: 
I encourage Onyu to keep up the good work.
As a next step of her growth, I would suggest Onyu to become more of a communicator, and to be more proactive during class debates.


## Wang, Longxi
Longxi is a polite and quiet student who has settled in well to the class. Longxi uses her translation pen to help her understand the topics covered in class; despite this setback, she managed to improve and to reach the maximum score in 3 out of the 4 criteria. I am sure that if she continues to maintain this level of diligence, she will be able to bring the Investigating skills to the same level of the other criteria.

Recommendation:
Longxi should continue to use her translator pen whenever necessary as it is a very useful resource for her.
I would encourage Longki to be more proactive during class debates and start using more spoken English to improve her command level.
