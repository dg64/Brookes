				Advantages: lower fixed costs, compared to a physical store; collection of first-hand data
				about preferences of customers
				Disadvantages: increased stock; possible management of returned goods; website maintanment

		d		7/10
				You need to revise this topic. When there is a take over, the company bought ceases to exist.
				In the specific case TS, securing a network of outlet, will take care that its products will have
				the best places in the shops, relegating the ones of the competition to more visible locations.

				TC = ($2 x 60.000) + $100.000 = $220.000

			iii	1/2
				The logic is correct but the result is wrong because it is affected by your previous calculation

		c		1/2
				You were expected to say that the line of the total cost will have a lower intercept with Y axis, due
				the lower fixed costs; in addition the steepness of the line will decrease, since the the variable costs
				are lower by 10%; as a result, the BE will be also lower.

Question 2

Section B

Question 3

		a		2/2

		b		2/2

		c		4/6
				I do not accept the extra workers reason. A website requires a higher stock; it requires maintenance
				and qualified personnel

		d		6/10
				Here you were expected to mention the two different types of external growth, with advantages and disadvantages;
				You need also to revise the Ansoff Matrix, as the strategy pursued by the company with a merger can be classified
				as market penetration if the competitor is in the same country, as a market development if the competitor is in
				another country.
