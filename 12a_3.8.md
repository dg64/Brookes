Question 2      2/2

Question 3      1/3
                Incorrect calculation

Question 3      3/4
                you did not include the scrap value

Question 4      8/10
                The answer is well structure and well balanced, with reference
                to the stimulus material. The problem is that you define an ARR
                of 0.85% a high one; 0.85 means less than 1% of profitability,
                which is extremely low, that number alone should have told you
                that your previous calculation was not correct.
