                you did not include the scrap value

Question 4      8/10
                The answer is well structure and well balanced, with reference
                to the stimulus material. The problem is that you define an ARR
                of 0.85% a high one; 0.85 means less than 1% of profitability,
                which is extremely low, that number alone should have told you
                that your previous calculation was not correct.

Question 5      7/10
                Good that you referenced the stimuls material.
                You do not have the knowledge yet to answer this question
                but one thing you knew and you did not mention it.
                You knew, from profitability analysis, that low morale and
                low motivation lead to quality issues in the production
                processs. These issues can damage the reputation of the
                company. The investment, even though profitable, does not
                address and does not solve the problem of low retention
                rate

                advantages and disadvantages and that you reference the stimulus 
                material; for the future tests, try to elaborate more the content
                of an asnwer worth 10 points.

Question 5      5/10
                I grant you 5 points by in reality these should be 3.
                You need to reference the stimulus material in your analysis; meanning
                that you need to mention how long is the payback period and how much
                is the ARR; the investment does not resolve also the problem of the
                low staff retention, but I can excuse that since you do not have all
                the information yet to answer such a question.
                Last but not least, you did not write any conclusion.
