Question 4	3/10
		I am impressed by the level of your knowledge; however, there are some 
		prerequisite to answer a question that is worth 10 points: you need to
		write a mini essay with an introduction, a body and a conclusion.
		In the body you must provide two advantages and two disadvantages.
		The lack of a structural element or an imbalance in the answer cut
		the score in the half. You collected two of them and this is way
		you have such a low score.

		There are two problems in your answer:
		- you mention partner, but there are no partners in a PLC
		- you state that "shareholders hold the authority to input their
		  opinion and decisions into the business" that is not true
		  for PLCs. The only moment in which shareholders can express
		  their opinion is during the shareholders' assembly, when they
		  have to vote for the board of directors.

		Beside the fact that I do not want to see a bullet point in an answer
