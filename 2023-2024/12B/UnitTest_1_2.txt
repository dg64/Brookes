Question 1	1/2
		Partners are not shareholders

Question 2	2/4
		Theoretical answer

Question 3	0/4
		The question is about a partnership, not about a limited company.
		Where did you get the information about suing your partner?
		By the way, it is incorrect. Stick to the content of the syllabus.
		Your answer is theoretical

Question 4	1/10
		Stability is not related with a PLCs. Marketing has nothing to do with shares;
		companies do not sell shares as a core business.
		Money is not a business management term.
		In a flotation there is no "a chance to lose ownership". The status of a PLC is
		legal, there are no chances on that.
		Competitors will not have all the information about you. Again, where did you
		take this information?
		I suggest you to start paying attention during the lessons, instead of
		drawing.

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	0/4
		Saying that a partnership has limited liability means that you haven't learnt
		the vary basics

Question 3	0/4
		share decision making
		unlimited liability; the more the company grew, the more they were exposed

Question 4	1/10
		Economy of scale as a benefit for a flotation???
		Money is not a business management term
		Lower share price?
		"If the share decrease a lot, the company might not have enough money ..."????
		You wrote a bunch of nonsense. Revise the entire chapter about legal
		organizational types.
		I strongly suggest you for the future to pay attention to the lesson instead
		of chatting and minding your own businesses.

Question 1	1/2
		Insufficient.
		A business in which two or more owners share profit, risk, capital, and
		responsibilities

Question 2	2/4
		The partnership doesn't need to be 50/50. I never said that in my lessons.

Question 3	0/4
		Revise partnership

Question 4	0/10
		Loss in capital?
		Mass recognition?
		"with the increase of customer base, the company will have an opportunity to grow ..."
		The question was about advantages and disadvantages of setting up a PLC, not to analyze
		a market.
		Your answer is completely off-topic and you show no understanding of the content
		explained in this chapter.
		I suggest you to rethink about your attitude and pay more attention during the lessons.
