Question 3	2/4
		A change in social trend is not necessarily negative; in the case of IKEA,
		the increased sensitivity of  customers towards sustainability, was an
		opportunity for IKEA

Question 4	5/10
		you answer is theoretical
		For instance the size of the company allows IKEA to benefit from economies of 
		scale, but at the same time, it makes control much more difficult (this is a weaknesses), 
		and that could be a potential problem in countries where there is exploitation of workers        \
		and / or children (threat); to minimize the impact of these threats        
		IKEA sends inspectors in those countries."

		Yoy did not reference the stimulus material; actually you did in in the previous
		answer; there were plenty of examples to mention:
		For instance the size of the company allows IKEA to benefit from economies of 
		scale, but at the same time, it makes control much more difficult (this is a weaknesses), 
		and that could be a potential problem in countries where there is exploitation of workers        \

Question 3	2/4
		I do not see any link between threats and actions taken by IKEA
		For instance the size of the company allows IKEA to benefit from economies of 
		scale, but at the same time, it makes control much more difficult (this is a weaknesses), 
		and that could be a potential problem in countries where there is exploitation of workers        \
		and / or children (threat); to minimize the impact of these threats        
		IKEA sends inspectors in those countries."

Question 4	2/10
		Your answer is completely out of focus.
		The comment of the previous answer is an example of how SWOT enabled IKEA to identify this
		weakness that could become a threat of the business in terms of bad publicity. After the
		identification of the threath, IKEA could find a way to minimize it.

Question 4	6/10
		You lost 2 point just for using the word "money"
		The mission statement does not have to be specific. "Well designed and low cost" per perfectly
		fine, per se, and they are not related with SWOT

Question 3	4/4
		You wrote too much for a question worth 4 points

Question 4	2/10
		Besides the fact that I do not see any link between threates and weeknesses and how these
		were managed
		For instance the size of the company allows IKEA to benefit from economies of 
		scale, but at the same time, it makes control much more difficult (this is a weaknesses), 
		and that could be a potential problem in countries where there is exploitation of workers        \
		and / or children (threat); to minimize the impact of these threats        
		IKEA sends inspectors in those countries."
		Your analysis also shows an incorrect understanding of SWOT analysys. The goal of the tool
		is not the one of giving a solution; there is no such Business Management tools; SWOT helps
		you analyze internal and external factors that, when matched, can be on apportunity to 
		exploit or a threat to manage.

		SWOT is not the first stake of planning

Question 2	4/4

		What you describe in your answer is not the company of the case study.
		Nowhere is written that  IKEA "keeps its prices as low as possible because it manly targets

Question 4	4/10
		What is the meaning of the statement: "Each business has its own SWOT"??
