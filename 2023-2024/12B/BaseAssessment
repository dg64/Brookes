Question 1	2/2

Question 2	0/4
		Here you missed the point. For starting up that business, you would need
		Labour: yourself
		Land: your room
		Capital: a laptop
		Enterprise: your initiative

Question 3	2/4
		I accept the first reason but not the second. The growth of population has not a positive
		correlation with the growth of development; often it is the contrary.
		One other advantage is that you can use one of your current skills to start up a business
		in the tertiary sector

Question 4	5/10
		I can not accept the advantages, because:
		- during recession the competition become stronger, as every business is fighting for survival
		- setting up a business meaning, most of the time, starting alone, even more in a period of 
		  recession in which all finances are limited and the access to loan is expensive

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	3/4
		I do not grant you the full score because you used the plural in your answer.
		The business case is about starting up a business in recession; the people interested in
		that are all sole trader; these people will be alone with their business, they can not
		afford to haire workers.

Question 3	2/4
		When giving the second reason you switched perspective, from the business to the consumer.
		You do not rely on skills and interest of the consumers.

Question 4	5/10
		The format of your answer is perfect; the content is not yet at the same level.
		During recession there is an increase in competitivity, as companies fight for survival.
		Other companies do not finance you to start up a new business; as a startupper, is up to
		you to find the capital necessary for opening your business.
		Business can not have an abundance of loans; beside that, the question and the test case
		is about starting up a new business during recession time.

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	0/4
		Here you missed the point. For starting up that business, you would need
		Labour: yourself
		Land: your room
		Capital: a laptop
		Enterprise: your initiative

Question 3	2/4
		You need to read carefully the test case; Microsoft does not provide any CVs to school leavers.
		Skills and technology are two separate things; you can have a skills, like being a good 
		electrician or an hydraulics or an artisan; all of these skills have nothing to do with
		technology.

Question 4	5/10
		Beside the fact that the structure of your answer is a bit confused and doesn't make it easy
		to track advantages and disadvantages listed, there are a few problems in your analysis:
		- the statement that McDonalds' and Burger King might take advantage of a recession is true,
		  but you must explain why; you need to argument your statements, to show your understanding
		- during recession there is much more competition

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	2/2
		The only thing that is not correct in your answer is the plural. The question is about
		a startup business

Question 3	2/4
		I accept only the first reason. Competition is not easier in the tertiary sector; one
		advantage that the tertiary sector gives you is that you can capitalize one of your
		existing skills

Question 4	5/10
		I can not accept the part related to the investors. Investors are attratected by other
		businesses, nor sole traders' startuppers. I stressed the point that the test case was
		about startup businesses.

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	3/4
		The factors of production are correct, but office? administrative staff?
		We are talking about a startup business. When you start you are alone.

Question 3	4/4

Question 4	5/10
		The structure of your answer is fine, the content is not; here is why:
		- during recession competition becomes stronger
		- investors do not invest in sole traders' startup
		- during recession it is clear what customer wants: consumer durables and
		  inferior goods

Sofiya Balyan

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	2/4
		Your answer is theoretical. You need to apply the content to the context;
		for a business providing CV to school leavers these are:
		Land: your room
		Capital: your notebook
		Labour: yourself
		Enterprise: your initiative to startup this business

Question 3	2/4
		As a service business you do not provide products.
		In your answer you talk about a business that can have as a target customers
		both other businesses and end consumers. Which business are you talking about?

Question 4	2/10
		This answer is absolutely unacceptable; you were supposed to write a mini essay.

Question 2	3/4
		You completely discarded the size and the stage of the business.
		The question was about starting a business as a sole trader. No office, no staff.

Igor d'Adhemar De Gransac

Question 1	2/2
		Services are not produced. Services are delivered.

Question 2	3/4
		This is a generous grading, since you completely missed the size and the type
		of some factors of production, namely management and graphic design

Question 3	0/4
		Starting up a business doesn't have production cost but still has costs
		Growing is not granted, even more fast growing; there are a number of
		successful business that started small and did not grow

Question 4	3/10
		Just because your answers misses two structural components you receive a 3.
		I do not have to read the content of your answer, but if I have to, I will
		have to say that providing a bullet point list is not acceptable as well.
		You need to write a mini essay.

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	4/4
		Just notice that in this specific case, the labour is provided by the same
		person that started up the business.

Question 3	2/4
		I accept only the first point, besides the fact that less capital is not equal
		to less stress. The capital investment required to deliver a service depends
		on the type of service that you want to deliver; you can not always assume
		a cheap cost of the equipment.

Question 4	5/10
		The structure of your answer is fine, the content is not; here is why:
		- during recession competition becomes stronger
		- due to recession, prices are low, that can reduce the startup capital

Danil Konoplev

Question 1	1/2
		Revise the definition of economies and their classification in sectors.
		Startups are nothing to do with it

Question 2	0/4
		You missed the point of the question; you were required to listed the
		factors of production for a startup business that provides CVs to 
		school leavers.
		Labour: yourself
		Land: your room
		Capital: a laptop
		Enterprise: your initiative

Question 3	4/4
		I consider the two options that you gave in the point a) for good.
		What you wrote for option b) is completely wrong and unsubstantiated.

Question 4	2/10
		The structure of the answer is correct; the content is completely off.
		You use the terms recession and depression as synonims while they are not.
		One thing among the many wrong ones: during recession there is no growth.

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	3/4
		Land: your room is still a place
		Worker: yourself

Question 3	4/4

Question 4	5/10
		You can not talk about investor for sole traders' startup. Investors
		are interest in different type of businesses.
		Lower prices and easy of entry are two advantages. Competition is stronger
		but during recession customers are looking for cheap durable goods/services,
		so it is easy to target them. 
		Banks can be ruled out; the period is not favourable and as a startupper,
		you do not offer any guarantee.

Question 3	4/4

Question 4	5/10
		- greater competition
		- low cost and employment demand? We are talking about a startup business

		  have any employees

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	4/4
		Someone is you

Question 3	2/4
		You need knowledge of the business; actually you need to perform a basic
		market research. One other advantage is that you can capitalize one of your
		skills

Question 4	4/10
		There are many incorrect assumptions in your essay.
		During recession there is a greater competition; not necessarily established 
		businesses will close. Consumer are interested only if you offer them what
		they are looking for in tha specific period. You mention new opportunities 
		without specifying which ones. 
		The funding of a new business (a startup one) must come by own saving, not
		from the government; it is unrealistic to hope for subsidies and grant.
