		- laissez-faire is not appropriate for a school environment

Question 4	6/10
		The lack of team work in an autocratic management style, is not

Question 1	2/2

Question 2	2/4
		A manager does not establish his authority yelling at students.
		Enforcing the obervation of school regulations is part of the
		management activity

Question 3	4/4
		Good answer

Question 4	5/10
		Autocratic style is not motivating at all.
		The other one is the paternalistic style.
		The french one is the "Laissez-faire"; if you do not remember the 
		french words, just use "let them do"; in this stile students do not
		decide, and at the same time they do not get any direction, and for
		that you are frustrated.
