Question 4      8/10
                It seems that you compare Flow production with batch production.
                Two disadvantages of cellular production:
                - slower than flow production
                - it requires a duplication of equipment as each cell is completely
                  autonomous

Question 2      2/4
                Ok for the investiment; but not for the miscommunication.
                Once a flow line is set-up, there is very little human intervention;
                communication included

Question 3      2/4
                Ok for self-managing, not for a stage o work, because this looks like a batch
                production processing. In a cell, the team assembles a complete unit of work;
                team members are multi skilled and rotate in their tasks.

Question 4      7/10
                I grant you 7 points, but be aware of:
                in the second advantage you did not reference the change of corporate culture necessary
                to adopt lean manufacturing and cellular production
                in the conclusion you added new information; information that was supposed to be in your
                analysis. Take to put only your conclusion at the end of your answer.

Question 2      2/4
                Be careful with the word "stage" when you are talking about flow production; with this method
                there are no stages; just a continuous flow.

Question 3      1/4
                Insufficient description

Question 4      5/10
                You need to revise this topic.
                Costs for switching to Cellular production are related to the duplication of equipment in each 
                cell; cellular production is slower than flow production but it is more motivating; it eliminates
                some disadvantages of batch production (like excess movement and WIP), but it requires a change
                in corporate culture as any member of the staff must think and behave in lean terms.

                You need to provide more than just bullet points

Question 3      4/4
                Same as above

Question 4      7/10
                You're improving.
                You were expected to talk only abaout cellular production, not about flow production
                You were expected to elaborate more the advantage and disadvantages of cellular production:
                + increased motivation
                + elimination of movements between workstationw
                - expensive as equimpment must be replicated for each cell
                - it requires a change in corporate culture
