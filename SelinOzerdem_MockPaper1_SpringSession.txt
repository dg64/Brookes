Question 4

		a	0/2
			easy to calculate
			does not take into account the market and the competition

		b	0/4
			There is no such thing as damage control in TQM

		c	1/4	
			You need to reference the stimulus material. In this case the variance analysis allows
			SVT to see that sales are lower than forecasted and costs are higher that forecasted.
			The variance analysis allows SVT to monitor these deviations and take actions

		d	2/10
			You are required to make an analysis with benefits and drawbacks, referencing the
			stimulus material. Two for each option given. Just repeating what is in the text is not
			an analysis. There is also no conclusion in your answer.

Section C

	Criterion A 1
	Criterion B 1
	Criterion C 1
	Criterion D 3
	Criterion E 0

	Here you completely discarded the stimulus material involving ARR and NPV. The text instructed also to calculate
	the payback period to make the analysis. There is not trace of that in your text, which makes me assume that
	the topic of Investment Appraisal is unknown to you. You were also required to write a paragraph related to
	two groups of stakeholders.
