Question  1     2/2

Question 2      2/4
                The percentage of tax does not change, so you can not say that with a 
                partnership the partners pay less taxes. One advantage, not mentioned
                in the textbook, is that a partnership is not subject to double
                taxation

Question 3      4/4

Question 4      0/10
