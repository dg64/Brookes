# DaniilLavrentyev - Chapter 2: Business Classification

Question 1      2/2

Question 2      0/2
                shipment from suppliers
                delivery to customers

Question 3      0/4
                AEC needs natural resources as input for
                its manufacturing process
                AEC operates in the secondary sectors; it needs
                natural resources in input, coming from the
                primary sector

Question 4      0/6
                Being AEC successful, we may assume that the secondary
                sector has developed at the expenses of the primary
                sector. Moreover, the increase of consumer incomes may
                may lead to an increase in demand of services,
                pushing the development of the tertiary sector, and
                furtherly diminishing the importance of the primary
                sector

Question 5      0/6
                You did not read carefully the question. You were not
                asked to make a comparison between private and public
                businesses. Despite services, consumers will always 
                need goods; more goods; more expensive goods; and
                these will be provided by the secondary sector

Question 6      0/2
                sector in which companies are owned by the goverment

Question 7      0/2
                manufactoring, food processing

Question 8      0/4
                with increased standards of life, the demand of services
                increases as well.
                the number of companies providing services exceeds the
                number of companies providing goods

Question 9      0/6
                companies in the private sector are more efficient
                public companies privatized will not require tax payment
                for financial support

Question 10     0/6
                Here again you missed the point of the question.
                Businesses in the private sector have profit as a main goal
                Businesses in the public sector have the delivery of services
                to all citizens as a main goal; for this reason they are
                inherently inefficient
