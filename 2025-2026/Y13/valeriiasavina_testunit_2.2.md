Question 3      0/4
                That is not the reason. With the help of electronic
                communication (email, text messages), now top
                manager can communicate directly and without filters
                with employees and workers

Question 4      6/10
                You need to elaborate more your options. You talk about
                costs but you do not mention efficiency. You say that
                work increases for employees, but that is not true;
                work increases for managers because their span of
                command increases.

Total Score     12/20 Grade 4
