Question 3      4/4

Question 4      7/10
                Please avoid words like "money" as it is not a BM term; use "cash" instead, or
                "financial resources". 
                Your answer has all the necessary elements but it is difficult to read; I suggest
                you to structure more clearly the body of your answer: 1st advantage and 1 corresponding
                disadvantage; 2nd advantage and 1 corresponding disadvantage.
