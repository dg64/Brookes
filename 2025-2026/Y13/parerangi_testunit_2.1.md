            Training is of course taxed, as it is accounted as hoverhead; however, since it lowers
            the EBIT, it also lowers the amount of tax paid; in your analysis you completely discarded
            the improvement in the service delivered to customers, while you insisted on the fact
            that employess will have better opportunities with a professional development. The
            advantage for the employees was clear, but you did not explain the advantage for the
            business.
