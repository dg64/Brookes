Question 5 4/4

Question 6 4/4

Question 7 0/5
 
 Business plan was not yet explained.
 You need:
 Idea, Capital, Location, Customer base
 
 Question 8 0/6
 
 You do not pick the best cost; you chose to invest in what you think
 is the most profitable option
 You need also to realize that the option that you are giving up may no longer
 be available in the future. These considerations help managers to make a 
 informed choice.
 
 Question 9 2/5
 
 If a startup does not provides what is in demand,  then why starting up that business?
 I repated this countless times during the lesson.
 If you know that customers will have a cheaper choice, then again what is the purpose
 of a startup?
 
 Question 10 0/8
 
 You did not read the question.  A startup business usually does not have employees, it is just
 the entrepreneur. A startup business has tight finances; writing CV can be done with your own
 laptop (capital), in your hown room (land) by yourself (labour)
