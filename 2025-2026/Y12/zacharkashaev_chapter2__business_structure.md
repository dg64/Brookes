Question 1  1/1

Question 2  3/3

Question 3  0/3
            You did not answer the question: Secondary sector

Question 4  0/3
            Again you did not answer the question: Tertiary sector

Question 5  4/8
            I accept the lack of experience in the retail market
            The second difficulty is the amount of finance required

Question 6  2/12
            You need to revise the legal organizational types.
            You can not propose that a sole trader becomes a PLC; that
            means that you haven't understood the difference between
            different legal organizational types. This is shown also
            by what you wrote about the partnership. The risk are
            unlimited liability and no continuity; and you forgot to
            mention it in the event that you gave as an example

Question 7  1/1

Question 8  3/3

Question 9  0/6
            - The company grew
            - The accountant suggested the flotation

Question 10 0/8
            They already had limited liability as an LTD
            Becoming a PLC does not mean that you do not have
            "much control", it means that you do not have control
            at all

Question 11 0/12
            Beside the fact that what you wrote is insufficent for 12 points
            You seriously need to revise the legal organizational types.
            You have huge gaps.
