# KindaShreif Chapter2: Business Structure

Question 1  1/1
            Too much for an answer worth 1 point

Question 2  3/3

Question 3  0/3
            There are no sectors of capital goods and consumer goods
            secondary sector

Question 4  0/3
            Tertiary sector

Question 5  8/8

Question 6  5/12
            The answer is unbalanced as you did not provide any negative
            aspects; the one you gave are incorrect. Partnerships do not
            have shares. LTD do not sell shares to the free market.
            You need to revise these legal organizational types.
            Both in an LTD and in a partnership Joe would not be the sole
            owner.

Question 7  1/1

Question 8  1/3
            Why did you mention bonds? IPO is the first sale on the share
            market by a company that went public

Question 9  3/6
            I accept the first part of the answer.
            Suggestion by the accountant

Question 10 6/8
            Interest on profit? Care to explain?

Question 11 6/12
            I give you half the score because the question has the required
            structural elements. However, I see that you haven't clear yet
            the difference between an LTD and a PLC.

Total Score 31/60 Grade D
